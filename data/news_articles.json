                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we talk about STELLAR, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)’s new tool to help electricity distributors manage power supply and possibly move towards zero power cuts in India.\nBut before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nOver the last decade, India has been rushing to add a lot of solar and wind power to its\nelectricity system\n. In theory, that sounds great. Clean, renewable energy is good for the planet.\nBut here’s the problem. Most of these renewables don’t have proper storage systems like big batteries to save the extra energy generated during the day for use later. So, when the sun sets in the evening, especially during those hot summer months of May and June when people still need fans, ACs and lights, there’s a power shortage. Solar panels stop working, but the demand stays high.\nTo make things worse (but better for the climate of course), India also slowed down building new thermal power plants — the coal plants that act as reliable, always-on sources to keep the grid stable when renewable supply drops.\nSource:\nMinistry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\nThis means that without enough of these steady sources, the electricity grid becomes unstable, and power outages start becoming more frequent. For context, as of March 2024, India had an estimated total electricity generation capacity of about\n520 GW\n— around 280 GW from coal or thermal energy, 198 GW from renewables and the rest from gas and nuclear. But in May 2024, India’s peak power demand hit\n250 GW\n. That left very little breathing room or spare capacity for thermal plants to increase their plant load factor (PLF). That’s basically, how much of their maximum capacity is actually being used. These plants are already working hard, and there isn’t much extra capacity left to ramp up further when demand spikes.\nAnd this problem isn’t going away. India’s power consumption grew by 7% in 2023, compared to the global average of just 2%.\nSo yeah, while the country plans to increase renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, if demand and supply don’t grow at the same pace, power cuts could become a regular thing. At least that’s what a research report from the India Energy and Climate Centre, University of California, says.\nBut it seems as though India’s electricity authorities want to prove this theory wrong. Just a few days ago, the\nCentral Electricity Authority\n(CEA) launched a new indigenously built software tool called STELLAR. It’s basically a smart simulator for India’s electricity grid or a master planner for electricity generation, transmission, storage and demand management. It helps discoms (power distribution companies) figure out how much power they’ll need in the future, where it should come from, where to store it, and how to balance supply and demand without wasting money or causing blackouts.\nThe best part? It’s being shared free of cost with all states and discoms, so everyone works off the same standard tool, improving planning and cutting unnecessary costs.\nAlso, it ensures that discoms have sufficient power supply to meet demand without overcapacity, which the\nMinistry of Power’s guidelines\nfrom June 2023, warned against. Because when states overestimate their needs, it leads to idle capacity, unnecessary capital expenses and higher operational costs for discoms. Sure, this extra cost can be passed on to consumers through higher tariffs. But then, that’s not really something consumers will like, nor is it good for a state’s political environment, since power pricing in India is primarily regulated by the state.\nThe smarter way is to find a balance. And that’s what STELLAR aims to do. It improves pricing efficiency by using real time data and forecasting, allowing for more accurate, cost reflective tariffs. Plus, by supporting dynamic pricing models like\nTime of Day (TOD) tariffs\n, it encourages people to shift their power use to cheaper, off-peak hours. If you’re new to TOD, here’s how it works. The day is divided into three parts — solar hours, peak hours and normal hours. Use more power during solar hours, pay less. Use it when demand spikes after sunset, pay more. That’s the idea.\nThis can reduce pressure on the grid, lower system costs and cut down on the need for expensive backup options like diesel generators. And hopefully, prevent massive blackouts like the one in July 2012, when\n620 million people\nor 9% of the world’s population at the time, were left in the dark.\nBut does that mean that STELLAR can just magically fix India’s power supply problems?\nWell, maybe not. Because here’s the thing. While the tool itself is free for discoms, its benefits might still be limited. And that’s mainly due to the fact that Indian discoms aren’t exactly in the best of health.\nTo put things into perspective, according to rating agency\nICRA\n, the all India aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, which basically means losses that happen due to inefficient transmission, distribution issues, theft or unpaid bills, dropped from 23% in FY21 to 16% in FY23, thanks to infrastructure upgrades and subsidies from state governments. These subsidies help discoms keep electricity affordable for certain consumers.\nSounds like progress, right? But here’s the issue. Discoms in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh are still struggling, sitting on losses, some even above 20%.\nAnd when discoms are already struggling financially, they might not be in a position to implement necessary changes or invest in complementary infrastructure to truly benefit from a tool like STELLAR even if it’s being handed to them for free. And if state governments delay those subsidies we mentioned earlier, discoms face cash flow problems, making matters worse. They might barely be able to cover operational expenses, let alone spend on optimising their systems with new tools.\nIncreasing tariffs to recover costs isn’t easy either. In India, electricity prices\naren’t entirely market driven\n. State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) set these tariffs, trying to strike a tricky balance, keeping discoms financially alive while ensuring people don’t burn holes in their pockets over power bills. To do this, they rely on cross subsidies. That means industries pay more so that the agricultural sector and households can pay less.\nNow, the National Tariff Policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, says that these subsidies can’t stretch beyond ±20% of the average cost of supply (ACoS). But here’s the catch. According to a paper by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, more than half the power sold in India breaks this rule. The biggest underpayers being domestic and agricultural consumers, who end up paying much less than they ideally should.\nAnd here’s why fixing this is so difficult. A quote from the paper explains it well:\nThe general principle of raising tariffs quickly becomes political, more so if this is done disproportionately for one consumer group. Unfortunately, the lowest-priced segments are the ones with the greatest political clout—Residential and Agricultural.\nHow much tariff rise is too much? Much more than inflation is likely to be considered burdensome, but legacy issues including cost structure and demographic differences are also factors in tariff rises. A DisCom with limited (or even nil) tariff hikes in recent years, for whatever reason, needs a large jump.\nAny substantial rise needs to be spread out over several years.\nSo yeah, that might derail India’s plan for a rightly priced, balanced electricity supply with zero power cuts. And until we fix that, STELLAR might not be such a stellar idea after all.\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "title": "The economics of reviving extinct animals",
                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we explain why an American biotechnology company revived extinct dire wolves and whether it’s worth it.\nBut before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nHow would you feel if something that died over 12,000 years ago suddenly came back to life?\nWell… it sort of has. Or at least, something close enough to it, that no one in history has ever pulled off before.\nScientists at an American biotech company called\nColossal Biosciences\nhave almost revived the dire wolf, one of the most successful Ice Age predators that vanished after losing much of its prey, most likely thanks to human hunting.\nSidebar:\nYou’re probably familiar with these majestic, powerful white creatures if you’ve watched\nGame of Thrones\n.\nNow, when we say “almost revived”, it’s because this isn’t exactly the same animal coming back. Even though it’s been marketed as ‘de-extinction’, what the scientists have actually done is a bit different. They’ve used a cutting edge gene editing tool called CRISPR to modify the DNA of modern grey wolves. Then pieced together a full dire wolf genome using ancient DNA dug up from fossils that had been sitting in the earth for thousands of years. And finally, implanted these embryos into surrogate dogs.\nWhat’s interesting here is that dire wolves and grey wolves aren’t even close cousins. They split apart on the evolutionary tree somewhere between 2.5 to 6 million years ago. So yeah, these new pups, named Remus, Romulus and Khaleesi (because of course), are\nabout 99.5%\ngenetically identical to the original dire wolves.\nAnd since that’s close enough, we’ll just call it de-extinction for now.\nBut why even do this, you ask?\nIn simple terms, it’s about saving the planet. Every year,\naround 30,000 species\nquietly disappear. And even if you don’t notice it, the consequences are huge. Over half of the world’s economy or about $44 trillion relies on nature for food, raw materials, fuel and more. So when we lose species, we’re not just losing biodiversity; we’re losing the natural services that power economies, which could cost the global economy more than $5 trillion every single year.\nTo put it in starker terms, in the words of Dr. Jill Atkins and Barry Atkins, who wrote\nAround the World in 80 Species\n,\nExtinction, at its current rate, will ensure that financial markets will collapse, which will happen shortly before extinction of the human race if no urgent action is taken.\nSo yeah, preserving what’s left matters. And one way to learn how, is by bringing back what’s already gone. By studying revived species, scientists can pinpoint the exact genes responsible for traits that help animals survive in tough environments. That knowledge might give us clues to help endangered species adapt to a rapidly changing climate.\nNot just that. Releasing genetically engineered animals like woolly mammoths back into the wild could even slow down climate change. We know that sounds crazy, but mammoths could help preserve the rapidly melting permafrost in the Arctic by trampling down snow and encouraging grasslands to grow (we’ve written about it\nhere\n). That’s also why Colossal isn’t stopping with dire wolves or mammoths. They’re eyeing other long-lost creatures like the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo too.\nBut here’s the thing. Everything we’ve talked about so far is a business pitch Colossal has built around this whole idea of de-extinction. It makes it sound like a win for the planet. And it’s clearly working. Venture capitalists seem to be sold on the dream, valuing the company at a jaw-dropping\n$10.2 billion\n!\nBut our question is — is this really worth the money?\nLet’s think this through. Some of the species Colossal wants to revive might eventually be rewilded. The dire wolves, for instance,\nwon’t be released\ninto the wild. They’ll stay inside a 2,000 acre preserve with round the clock care, and for now, they won’t be allowed to breed either. But for other species, like the red wolf or the woolly mammoth, Colossal hopes to eventually let them roam free.\nAnd when those animal populations grow, guess who’ll foot the bill? Regional governments. The same ones already struggling to fund existing conservation projects. For perspective, the world currently spends just 17% of the\n$824 billion\nneeded each year for biodiversity conservation. Which means we’re already 83% short.\nAnd researchers are worried about this too. A\nstudy\npublished in\nNature Ecology and Evolution\n, a peer reviewed scientific journal, dug into what it would actually cost to look after resurrected animals. They used data from New South Wales, Australia and New Zealand, which carefully track conservation costs for endangered species, and applied those numbers to de-extinct animals. For example, looking after a woolly mammoth would likely cost as much as caring for an endangered Asian elephant.\nBut these estimates don’t include the massive up-front costs of bringing these animals back in the first place. So, even on paper, it’s a\ngrim picture\n.\nThe researchers even mapped out two scenarios — one where the government takes on the responsibility, and another where private companies sponsor it. In the first case, pulling money from existing conservation budgets to fund these de-extinct creatures would actually reduce overall biodiversity. In fact, for every species revived, about two existing ones could go extinct because of underfunding!\nAnd this would only make an already skewed system worse. If you didn’t know, most of the world’s\nconservation money\ngoes towards bigger, more ‘charismatic’ animals. And because of that, many equally important animals and plants get left behind. To give you an idea, even within the vertebrate family, a staggering 85% of resources go to birds and mammals, while poor amphibians get just 3% of the funding. So imagine how lopsided it might get once woolly mammoths and dire wolves start grabbing the spotlight.\nAlso, economics aside, ecosystems have evolved without these animals. So it’s unclear whether they’ll thrive in today’s world or upset the delicate balance of species already there.\nA study\nin\nScientific Reports\n, another peer reviewed journal on natural sciences, tried to estimate how many woolly mammoths the modern Arctic could actually handle. The answer was between 48,000 to 72,000, which is still an optimistic upper limit. But even if numbers stay lower, there’s still a risk of them clashing with species like caribou and muskoxen for food or simply struggling to cope with a world they no longer recognise.\nAnd that feels a bit like going around your elbow to get to your mouth. If current conservation projects get neglected in favour of flashy de-extinction ones, we might end up worsening biodiversity loss and the economic crisis it fuels.\nBut for Colossal, it’s not just about saving nature. It’s business. They could be making billions by bringing back long-lost animals and calling it conservation. If Colossal manages to successfully resurrect and reintroduce any of these species into the wild, they’re hoping to cash in by\nselling biodiversity credits\n, a market based system kind of like carbon credits, where companies or countries pay for actions that help balance out environmental damage.\nOn top of that, government partnerships could open up another money making avenue. Right now, Colossal offers its conservation technology to governments for free. But with some countries already reaching out for help to save their endangered species, it’s not hard to imagine a future where those services come with a price tag.\nWould Colossal make the same billions by focusing only on saving the species we already have? Probably not.\nSo yeah, while it’s undeniably cool, this whole de-extinction thing might be playing a dangerous game with nature and money. And we might need to take a cautionary lesson from\nJurassic Park\n, the movie that warned us about this very thing decades ago.\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "Hey folks!\nSome people lose money in the stock market. Others? Well… they lose 25 kilograms of cow ghee in an Uber.\nYup! Uber just dropped its latest edition of the Lost and Found Index this week, and it’s wild (also funny). Bags, wallets, phones, are predictable things to leave in an Uber. But a bansuri (flute), a gold biscuit, a wedding saree and even a gas stove made the list this year. And while Delhi has finally stepped down from its forgetfulness throne, passing the crown to Mumbai, there’s been another shuffle too. Hyderabad has dropped off the list, making room for Kolkata’s grand entry into the top five.\nWhat’s even better is that people are most likely to misplace things at 7 pm, mostly on Saturdays. No surprises there. And if it’s a festive day, well… let’s just say Uber drivers probably double as unofficial lost and found officers.\nAnyway, while people are busy losing things in Ubers, let’s make sure we aren’t misplacing any interesting, unusual business stories this week.\nOn that note, let’s dive in.\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nSomething Stupid\nby Lola Marsh\nWe normally like picking songs from underrated Indian artists, but this recommendation by our reader Amit Kumar Eshore was worth breaking the mould for. Thanks, Amit!\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nThe bee-conomy is crashing and so are nature’s smallest workers\nI used to think honeybees were the villains of my childhood.\nOne sunny afternoon, while playing outside, I got stung on the finger. Which ballooned up like a cartoon thumb, and I swore vengeance (well, at least a week of grumbling). But then, on the way to the doctor, my uncle told me something that changed everything. “Those bees you’re mad at? They’re the heroes of the food world”, he said.\nHe gave me an analogy of how bees were like the unpaid interns of our planet’s kitchen. Because these tiny creatures pollinate most of the world’s flowering plants (over 75% today) — fruits, veggies, nuts, even your morning coffee. They have a big production value (of\n$350\nmillion in 2023 alone). So without them, grocery shelves would look bleak, and diets would turn bland.\nBut here’s the stinger. Bees are vanishing. This winter, commercial beekeepers in the US lost nearly\n60%\nof their colonies. That’s the biggest collapse since tracking began in 2011, affecting over two-thirds of managed bees. And the fallout is already showing. California’s almond orchards (home to\n80%\nof global almond production) are facing pollination shortfalls.\nAnd what’s weird is that scientists still don’t know the exact cause. Virus? Pesticides? Climate stress? Probably all of it.\nBut this isn’t new. Since the early 2000s, we’ve seen a rise in something called Colony Collapse Disorder, where entire hives vanish without warning. One big reason? Bees are\nstarving\n. Erratic weather messes with blooming cycles, and when flowers don’t appear on time, bees go looking and don’t make it back. Throw in pesticide exposure, and it’s a disaster waiting to happen. Meanwhile, the ongoing USDA budget and funding cuts have slowed crucial research and support for beekeepers.\nIt’s not just bees either. Insects overall like butterflies, beetles and ants are vanishing fast. These little guys are vital to food production, plant growth and waste breakdown. And their disappearance is nature’s giant red flag.\nBut here’s something that caught our attention…\nThe US has a record\n3.8 million\nhoneybee colonies. But beekeepers are simply cloning hives to keep up. Think of it like making copies of a sick patient and hoping one survives. Some are turning to\nmason bees\n, who pollinate better but they don’t produce honey or live in hives (perhaps the reason for their low adoption among beekeepers).\nAnd yeah, this isn’t just America’s problem. India, too, has had its brushes with\nbee crises\n. Mass bee disappearance in Orissa, Punjab, Maharashtra and Kerala have been linked to excessive pesticide use and the push for non-native bee species.\nSure, there’s hope as localised beekeeping, rooftop hives and indigenous bee initiatives are taking root.\nBut the bottom line is that bees are going. And that’s nature telling us something. These tiny creatures are nature’s early warning system. And when they’re distressed, it means the planet is too. Strangely fascinating, but unsettling too, yeah?\nSo the next time you see one buzzing by, maybe don’t shoo it away. Bee kind. It’s doing a lot more for your diet than you think.\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\n10th of April, 1912 — The Titanic sets sail. But so do insurance payouts that shook the maritime world.\nOn this day, the RMS\nTitanic left Southampton\n, England, on its maiden voyage to New York City with 2,200 passengers onboard. It was supposed to be unsinkable and a floating marvel. Massive, luxurious and powered by cutting-edge marine engineering. But just four days later, the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic, claiming over 1,500 lives.\nNow, you probably know this story. Maybe even watched it unfold with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio on screen.\nBut here’s a version you probably haven’t: the financial one.\nThe Titanic was\ninsured\nfor\n$5 million\n. And that was a staggering amount back then. The coverage came from a syndicate of insurers and was led by the renowned insurer Lloyd’s of London.\nAnd when disaster struck, the claims rolled in fast. Life and accident insurance claims alone crossed\n$3.4 million\n. Some of them made headlines. The family of railroad executive John B. Thayer received over $170,000, and another passenger, Herbert Chaffee, held the largest individual policy of $146,750. So adjusted for inflation, we’re talking millions today. And all of it collectively made Titanic not just one of the deadliest disasters, but one of the costliest in insurance history.\nAnd just like that, the business of risk changed.\nInsurers rewrote the rules. They raised premiums for transatlantic voyages, tightened underwriting standards and turned to reinsurance (basically, insurance for insurers) to spread risk. Marine actuarial science, the business of calculating the odds of sinking, suddenly got a lot more serious.\nAnd the episode also reshaped global regulations. Because within two years,\nin 1914\n, countries created the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which set new rules for lifeboats, emergency drills and continuous radio communication. In short, governments began treating safety as a financial priority and not just a moral one.\nSo yes, the Titanic sank. But what rose in its place was a new era of risk management that still anchors the insurance and shipping industries today.\nOh, and if you want to know how some folks turned the Titanic tragedy into a money making scheme, you can check out\nthis piece\nby NDTV.\nReaders Recommend 🗒️\nThis week, our friend Anuradha Rao is back with another book recommendation ―\nPlato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar\n, by Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein.\nInterestingly, it’s a book that explains several philosophical concepts with jokes.\nThanks for the rec, Anuradha!\nThat’s it from us this week.

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we tell you about what’s up with tariffs and how they could affect the global economy.\nBut before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nIf we got a rupee for every time we heard the word\ntariff\nthis past month, we’d be sitting on a small fortune by now. Because Donald Trump has made tariffs the centrepiece of his economic strategy. Again.\nBut the thing about tariffs is that they aren’t a new invention. In fact, they’re one of the oldest tricks you can find in economic textbooks.\nBack in the day, the US didn’t run on income tax. It ran on tariffs. Foreign goods were taxed at the port, and that money helped build the country. Tariffs also protected fledgling industries from cheaper imports. And it worked. American manufacturing boomed under that protective umbrella.\nBut things took a turn in 1930 when the US passed the\nSmoot-Hawley Tariff Act\n. Tariffs jumped by 20%. Other countries hit back with their own tariffs. Global trade shrank. And while the tariffs didn’t single handedly cause the Great Depression, they certainly poured fuel on the fire.\nSo after World War II, that ended in 1945, the US flipped the script. It slashed tariffs and became the poster child for free trade. Income tax replaced tariffs as the primary source of government revenue. Global supply chains were born. Goods became cheaper. And everyone from companies to consumers benefitted.\nSource:\nPIIE\nSo you could say that the US was built on tariffs. They funded the government without burdening citizens and protected local industry during its vulnerable early stages.\nBut that was then and we live in a different world now.\nAnd before we dive into today’s drama, let’s quickly understand how tariffs actually work.\nLet’s say you own a bakery in India. You and your fellow bakers have agreed to sell cupcakes for ₹30. Life’s good. Then someone starts importing fancier cupcakes from France and sells them for ₹25. Customers flock to the cheaper option and your business tanks. So to protect Indian businesses, the government steps in and slaps a ₹10 tariff on each French cupcake. Now they cost ₹35. And just like that, your ₹30 cupcake is back in the game. That extra ₹10? That’s a tariff — a tax on imports to protect local jobs, fund the government, or pressure trade partners.\nWhich brings us to the modern era of tariffs.\nNow if you haven’t been tracking the recent tariff developments, here’s a TL;DR version. On April 2nd, Trump announced a\n10% blanket tariff\n, with 34% additional tariffs on Chinese goods and 20% on some EU imports. China hit back with 84%, and Trump retaliated by hiking Chinese duties to a jaw-dropping 125%. And recently, while Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries (with a baseline 10% still in place), China was left out.\nBut Trump’s no stranger to this game. Between 2017 and 2021, his first term saw tariffs on everything from washing machines to solar panels. And at the time, critics called it reckless and inflationary. But surprisingly, prices stabilised and some domestic industries saw a\nbump\n.\nSo now Trump wants to scale that experiment. And both his supporters and critics have a point.\nSupporters argue tariffs bring in money. In 2019, US customs revenue from tariffs was\n$72 billion\n. A 10% blanket tariff on all imports (which totalled\n$3.8 trillion\nin 2023) could generate hundreds of billions. Trump even floated\nreplacing income taxes\nwith tariffs. Plus, higher import costs could push companies to manufacture locally in the US, protecting jobs.\nBut the free trade crowd isn’t convinced. They say tariffs are just taxes on consumers. Importers pass on the higher costs to buyers. And retaliation is real. During Trump’s first term, China hit back with tariffs on US soybeans, and American farmers bled. Also, gains in one sector can cause pain in another. Steel tariffs might help US steelmakers, but carmakers relying on cheap imported steel could cut production and jobs.\nAnd the problems don’t end there. We live in a hyper interconnected world today. A single car uses nearly\n30,000 parts\n, and rebuilding all that domestically? Slow, expensive, and inefficient. And it could choke economic efficiency. Not to mention, tariffs could hurt the US globally. As countries begin to look elsewhere, the dollar could weaken and trade ties may erode.\nAnd all of that makes you ask, why is Trump pushing them strongly?\nWell, a few reasons.\nOne, it’s political. “We’re taxing foreign goods, bringing jobs home” makes a great pitch. Two, it’s strategic. Reciprocal tariffs aim to level the playing field. Meaning, if a country charges a 20% duty on American goods, the US will match that. So it’s about leverage. And then it’s also about the big picture. Trump’s camp believes open US markets have been exploited by countries like China, who use subsidies, currency tricks and lax labour laws.\nBut here’s the thing. Tariffs aren’t a magic fix. Even if they work, nobody knows how they pan out in today’s increasingly globalised world. Economists have debated them for over a century.\nTake right now, for instance. The US economy is sitting on a mountain of debt and it paid\n$583 billion\njust in interest so far this year. That’s a system running on borrowed money. Now imagine tariffs triggering a full blown trade war. Tensions rise, uncertainty creeps in, and suddenly markets get jittery. And in a highly leveraged system like this, even a small shock can spiral. Tariffs might look like a long term fix, but in the short run, they could easily tip a debt laden economy into a recession.\nMaybe that’s why Trump’s easing up. At least for now.\nAfter all, this trade war involves two biggest economies in the world and over $500 billion in US-China trade.\nSource:\nUnited States Census Bureau\nIt might seem to you that the US has an upper hand because China relies more on US exports, and it’s the world’s factory. But also note that the US runs a $295 billion trade deficit with China. This leaves China with\nexcess dollars\n, which it then recycles into US Treasury bonds. If it sells them in retaliation, it could rattle US markets. Things are fragile.\nAnd where does India fit in?\nWell, India hasn’t picked sides. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal says India has\nno plans to retaliate\n, and that its own tariffs aren’t “humongous”. The focus instead is on negotiation — a bilateral deal with the US and other trade agreements with biggies like\nthe UK\nand Europe.\nMeanwhile, China is calling for solidarity, urging India to\noppose\nwhat it calls US tariff “abuse”.\nYet, there’s silence from India and maybe that’s likely by design.\nBecause here’s the thing. This trade war might be an opportunity. If US companies want to diversify out of China but still need reliable, cost effective manufacturing partners, India might stand to gain. It doesn’t have to pick a side to benefit just yet. It just has to be ready. With the ability to plug into global value chains that are looking to recalibrate. But that window won’t stay open forever.\nFor now, global trade is realigning. And countries must choose between retreating behind tariff walls or adapting smartly.\nBecause when you toss a wrench into something as complex as global trade…\n…you never really know what’s going to snap.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

Please consider doing your own research before making any investment decisions.\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nAbout a year ago,\nwe wrote about Trent\n, the Tata-owned retail darling that was on a roll. Despite the broader apparel retail sector going through a bit of a slump, Trent was defying the odds. Its expansion plans looked unstoppable and its stock was flying high.\nAnd although the stock kept climbing after that, hitting an all-time high of around ₹8,345 per share sometime last year, the rally didn’t last. Over the past six months, it’s shed nearly a third of its value. And again just this Monday, it took another massive 15% nosedive. That’s\none of its worst\nsingle-day crashes since the COVID chaos of March 2020.\nSo, what’s going on?\nLet’s start with the heart of the matter — Trent’s operating profit, or more precisely, its EBITDA margins. Now, if you’re familiar with the company, you’d know that most of its revenue comes from two key brands: Zudio and Westside. And in the last quarter of FY25, both these brands have been growing aggressively. Especially Zudio, which went on an expansion spree, opening\n132 new stores\nand taking the total count to 765. That’s a staggering 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57% in store additions!\nBut such rapid growth doesn’t come cheap. More stores mean higher operational costs. There’s staff salaries, rentals, supply chain, the whole shebang. And that has likely put pressure on Trent’s operating profits this year.\nBut rising costs aren’t the only reason margins are under strain. There’s also been a subtle but important shift in Trent’s revenue mix. Last year, Zudio contributed about 57% to the company’s revenue, while Westside made up 43%. This year, the script has flipped. Zudio’s share has dipped to\n49%\n, while Westside now makes up 50%.\nOn paper, that might not seem like a big deal. After all, Westside has higher operating margins, right? But Zudio was the real money spinner in terms of volume. Its low cost, fast fashion appeal, sub ₹500 average selling prices and quicker inventory replenishments made it the poster child of Trent’s growth story. So, a decline in Zudio’s share raises eyebrows.\nAnd that dip likely came down to two key factors.\nFirst,\nKotak Institutional Equities\npointed out a potential issue: store cannibalisation. Zudio’s breakneck expansion led to overlapping locations. Basically, stores opening up in the same pin codes. That means they ended up eating into each other’s sales, keeping revenue growth flat even though new stores were mushrooming.\nSecond, Westside has been making quiet gains in the digital space.\nOnline sales\nthrough westside.com and the Tata Neu platform grew by 45% year on year in the first nine months of FY25. Online now makes up over 6% of Westside’s total revenue. So while Zudio’s physical store expansion hit a ceiling, Westside was quietly capturing more ground online.\nThen there’s rising competition. Just a few months ago,\nShein\nmade its comeback in India through Reliance after a five year break. And it isn’t stopping there. Reliance also has big plans for Yousta, its affordable fashion brand, with a bold target of\n1,000+ stores\n. Sure, Yousta had only about 55 stores as of October 2024, but the intent is clear. The fast fashion game is heating up, and investors are watching closely.\nBut perhaps the biggest trigger for Trent’s stock crash was the Q4FY25 financial update that dropped last weekend. Investors weren’t thrilled. And when they’re disappointed, they don’t hold back.\nTo put things in perspective, Trent’s revenue for Q4 grew by 28% quarter on quarter to ₹4,300 crores. And for the full year, revenue jumped by 39% to ₹17,600 crores compared to FY24. But wait… That’s a good thing right?\nMaybe. But if you’ve been a long observer or investor in Trent you might not feel the same.\nThat’s because this is a company that’s been setting the bar high for years. In Q4FY24, revenue had jumped 53% over the previous quarter. And over the past five years, quarterly revenue had been compounding at a whopping 43%. Compare that to this quarter’s 28% and the growth feels underwhelming. Even the 39% annual growth pales a bit when stacked up against FY24’s 54% jump over FY23.\nSo the problem isn’t the results. It’s the expectations. Investors had gotten used to a certain rhythm — quarter on quarter revenue growth of\n45%\nand EBITDA margins shooting up at a CAGR of 162% until FY24. And when this year’s numbers didn’t keep up that pace, the mood soured.\nAnd why did this happen, you ask?\nYou could blame the high base effect. Put simply, even though Trent added ₹4,955 crores in revenue this year, more than the ₹4,456 crores it added the year before, the percentage growth looks smaller because it’s now growing off a much bigger base. Think of it this way. If Trent earned ₹100 crores one year and ₹200 crores the next, that’s a 100% jump. But if it earns ₹350 crores the year after, that’s still a ₹150 crore increase. But percentage wise, it’s just 75%. So even if the company is growing more in absolute terms, it can mislead investors into thinking that the growth isn’t good enough.\nAdd to that the fact that the broader markets aren’t exactly in a cheerful mood either, thanks to global jitters sparked by Trump’s tariffs kicking in, and Trent has become a casualty in the process too.\nBut let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Trent’s fundamentals are still strong. It’s just that investor expectations shot through the roof. And when reality didn’t keep pace, the stock took a beating.\nSo yeah, maybe it’s worth looking at Trent with a bit more optimism.\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\n‘\nHow’s the market bloodbath feeling?\n’, a friend asked on our group chat a day ago.\nHonestly? Not bad. I’ve been saving up for real estate, but with markets correcting, sitting on that cash feels smarter than rushing into a big decision. Locking myself into an EMI to own an asset feels less smart than deploying it into stocks that are suddenly on discount. I don’t have to worry about monthly payments, I’ve got liquidity, and more importantly, I’m not scrambling to sell things in a panic. If anything, this correction could even throw up bargain deals in real estate.\nSo yeah, it feels like I’ve finally learned something from past market crashes.\nAnd, for once, it feels good to be in the Warren Buffett tribe.\nBecause while other billionaires watch their net worth shrink in the ongoing crash, Buffett’s probably sipping Cherry Coke with a smile.\nSource:\nBloomberg Billionaires Index\nHe’s made about $13 billion (in 2025) during what some are calling one of the worst crashes in years. And that’s no joke given that he oversees the $1 trillion behemoth that Berkshire Hathaway is – where a single misstep can wipe out billions.\nSo how does he stay so calm and keep winning?\nTurns out, the move he made wasn’t today. Buffett quietly began preparing in 2024, when market optimism was at its peak.\nLet us explain…\nBuffett, with all his folksy charm, just went back to his classic playbook. And it’s one that’s as much about what not to do, as it is about bold bets.\nWhile everyone was cheering on the bull run, Berkshire\nsold $134 billion\nworth of equities. And what did Buffett do with all that money? Nothing. He didn’t jump into private equity, buybacks, crypto, or chase the next AI boom. He parked that money in good ol’ US Treasury bills. Yes, boring but safe, predictable T-bills (something like short term government bonds in India).\nToday, Berkshire sits on $330 billion in cash. That’s\nmore than the combined value\nof Starbucks, Ford, X, New York Times, Target and Zoom! About half of it was added in 2024 (cash plus investments in Treasury bills in the image below), and over 85% of it is in short-term Treasuries earning about 5% a year. That’s over $14 billion in annual interest income! Without lifting a finger. Just for sitting tight.\nSource:\nBerkshire Hathaway annual report\nThat begs the question: Why did Buffett do what he did?\nWell, for one, Buffett is obsessed with valuations. He doesn’t care about hype. If something looks expensive, he’d rather wait than overpay. Or as he likes to say, “\nIt’s better to buy a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price.\n” So when markets were soaring, Buffett either saw a correction coming or simply didn’t see better opportunities than T-bills.\nAnd in 2024 he said it clearly. Stock valuations were just too high. His favourite market metric, the so-called “Buffett Indicator” (which compares the size of the stock market to the country’s GDP), had crossed 200% late last year. And that’s a level he once described as “playing with fire.” So he didn’t.\nSource:\nLongtermtrends\nAnd while the\nBuffett Indicator might not be foolproof\n, other signals like the S&P 500’s price to book ratio screamed overvaluation. The last time this ratio was as high as today was back during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s.\nSource:\nApollo Academy\nSo being the value investor that he is, Buffett liquidated as much equity as he could and waited instead. And while others danced on the fire, Buffett walked away with a hose in hand.\nThen we have macro chaos.\nWith Trump back and tariffs looming, Buffett likely didn’t want to get caught in another economic war. He’s even gone so far as to say that tariffs are a kind of\neconomic warfare\n. And when the world looks uncertain, Buffett’s first rule is simple: Don’t lose money.\nBut there’s also something else that might have made him amass such cash. Buffett is 94. And the succession plan at Berkshire is already in place. Greg Abel, his chosen successor, will soon take over. So that cash pile is not just a defensive play, it’s a baton. A war chest ready for the successor to deploy when the time is right.\nBecause the truth is, Berkshire hasn’t found big acquisition targets in recent years since everything’s just been too expensive.\nThis moment isn’t his first rodeo either. It’s classic Buffett-style investing.\nBack in 1999, when dot-com mania was peaking, Buffett sat it out. Tech stocks were flying and Berkshire looked old school. And then the bubble burst. Buffett survived and scooped up bargains while others nursed losses. Again in 2008, he went on the offensive. He bailed out Goldman Sachs and General Electric through stock deals that earned him billions. Even during COVID in 2020, when things crashed briefly, he stayed cautious — not because he didn’t have the money, but because the opportunity was too narrow.\nAnd that discipline, paired with Charlie Munger’s clarity and Berkshire’s long-term bets, has helped Berkshire deliver a whopping 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from 1965 to 2024. The S&P 500’s 10% CAGR during the same period falls flat in comparison. For perspective, ₹100 invested with Buffett in 1965 would be over ₹46 lakhs today. But in the S&P 500? Just about ₹27,000!\nWhich brings us to today.\nThe markets are panicking but Buffett isn’t losing sleep. Because if prices fall further, he’s ready to buy. If they don’t, he’s happy collecting billions in interest.\nAnd that, folks, is the beauty of having cash. It doesn’t just protect you, it gives you freedom to wait, to act, to ignore the noise and do what makes sense.\nSure, Buffett has more information, more tools and a massive team. But this isn’t about having an edge. It’s about patience. About looking for the right price and holding your nerve when everyone else is losing theirs.\nSo the lesson is simple: You don’t need a billion dollar portfolio to think like Buffett. You just need a little restraint. A little awareness of value. And a little dry powder when things go on sale.\nBecause when others are fearful, Buffett gets greedy. And now that fear is back, he’s probably getting ready to pounce again (He’s already seeing value in Japanese companies and investing there, for instance).\nIf that’s where you are too, pat yourself on the back and good luck building your portfolio!\nAnd if not, now’s as good a time as any to remember what Buffett taught us. It’s better to pay ₹80 for something worth ₹100, than ₹100 for something that might be worth ₹150 someday. That’s true in stocks, in real estate or even for mangoes at your local sabzi mandi.\nAnd cash? Cash lets you make bold moves when fear takes over the markets. Because that’s when Buffett acts. And maybe, that’s what you should prepare for too.\nSo tell us. How’s the market bloodbath feeling to you, and are you taking any notes from Buffett?\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we talk about the rise of AI agents and whether they could actually end the world of apps.\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nWhat if you never had to open an app again?\nImagine that you’re planning a trip. From the moment you step out of your house to boarding a flight or train, from booking your hotel stay to reserving a cab at your destination, every little detail is sorted. But here’s the twist. You don’t need to open a single app. No hopping between Expedia, Skyscanner or MakeMyTrip. No switching tabs, no downloading, no juggling five different interfaces. Instead, you’re just chatting with an AI agent, and it’s doing all the heavy lifting for you.\nSounds crazy, we know. But that’s where we’re heading.\nSo, what exactly is an\nAI agent\n?\nThink of them as super smart digital assistants. You give them a task, and they figure out how to get it done. Whether it’s pulling information from other apps, making decisions on the fly or even learning something new on the job, these agents are built to operate independently. They don’t need to be spoon fed instructions at every step. And they don’t forget what they’ve done before either.\nLet’s say a company used to need six people working round the clock to plan and execute its marketing campaigns. With an AI agent though, one person and the agent can wrap it all up in under an hour. Sure, that sounds like bad news for jobs, but there’s a bright side too. These AI agents could be a game changer in sectors facing severe talent shortages.\nTake cybersecurity, for instance. In 2023,\nover 5.5 million\npositions were lying vacant in the field globally. That leaves companies vulnerable. Without enough employees in the field, it’s tough to detect and respond to threats in real time. And it’s only getting worse. Research from the\nWorld Economic Forum\nshows that since 2024, the cyber security skills gap has widened by another 8%. Two out of every three organisations say that they just don’t have the talent they need to stay secure. This is where AI agents can step in. They can detect suspicious logins, block intruders accessing a system from odd locations or flag traffic spikes when hackers try to flood a website with fake visits. And they can act pretty quickly.\nBut that’s just in the corporate world. On the personal front, AI agents are just as handy. Whether you need to reset a password, analyse a complex spreadsheet, generate an image or just search the internet, they’ve got your back. And since they know how to tap into other systems to fetch what they need, you don’t have to juggle ten different apps just to get one job done.\nAmazon’s already testing this idea with an AI shopping agent feature called “\nBuy for Me\n”. So if Amazon doesn’t have a product you’re looking for, this AI agent will find it on other websites. And if you like what it shows, it’ll place the order, all without you ever leaving the Amazon app. That’s great for Amazon. Not so much for everyone else. Because if people stop hopping between apps and stick to the one where an AI agent gets everything done, other platforms could start losing serious ground.\nAnd that’s a problem. See, apps thrive on user traffic. More users mean more sales, more in-app purchases, more data to learn from and more advertising revenue. Apps make services easier to access. If you want to use Adobe’s design tools, the app streamlines your experience. But if users no longer feel the need to open that app, it loses business.\nNow, we’re not making this point just because of one new AI agent that Amazon is working on. AI agents aren’t exactly new and have been on the rise for a while now. For context, the global market for AI agents is projected to grow from\n$5 billion\nin 2024 to a whopping $47 billion by 2030. That’s a compounded annual growth rate of 45%!\nWhile much of this growth is on the business side, there isn’t much chatter about how they’re reshaping consumer habits. But if we were to take cues from generative AI, it’s clear that consumer focused AI agents might catch on pretty quickly. To put things in perspective, Gartner predicts a\n25% drop\nin search engine traffic by 2026, thanks to the rise of generative AI and personal AI agents. If that’s anything to go by, it’s entirely possible that you’ll be ditching apps and turning to an AI agent to get things done sooner than you think.\nSo… is this the end of apps?\nYou’d think so, right? Especially when you hear about AI agents like Midjourney helping you design stunning graphics just by chatting with it — no need to learn Adobe or Canva. Or Mindtrip, an AI travel planner that could replace your usual go to platforms like Expedia or TripAdvisor. In fact, even biggies like\nSatya Nadella\nand Nandan Nilekani see AI agents replacing apps in the future.\nSource:\nFelicis\nBut here’s the thing. History is proof that technology doesn’t always wipe out what came before. As\nChuck Whitten\n, Senior Partner at Bain & Company puts it beautifully, “One lesson history teaches us is that technological revolutions are rarely binary. Transitions don’t typically lead to total replacement. Instead, they create ecosystems marked by heterogeneity—a mix of old and new models, each finding its niche.”\nJust look at the PC. When smartphones and tablets exploded in popularity, many predicted the death of the personal computer. But this story you’re reading was actually written on a laptop. PCs didn’t disappear. They just found a new purpose. They’re still the go-to when you need to get serious work done. They’re built for focus, multitasking and heavy duty tasks that your phone just isn’t cut out for.\nOr take\nSlack\n. It promised to revolutionise workplace communication. And people thought email would fade into obscurity. But guess what? Email usage has only gone up globally from 280 billion emails sent and received daily in 2018 to 360 billion in 2024 (nearly a 30% increase). That number’s expected to hit 400 billion by 2027. Why? Because old habits die hard. Email still feels more formal, more “official”, especially in business. And once something becomes a norm, it’s tough to change it.\nThat’s perhaps how AI agents will coexist with apps too. Rather than killing them, they might nudge apps to evolve. We could see more apps building their own AI agent style features to keep users within their ecosystems. After all, third-party AI agents still need data and most of that data sits within the apps that have been around for years. If these apps invest in smarter AI interfaces of their own, they might offer better, more integrated experiences than any outside agent can.\nAnd here’s another thing. While one AI agent might help you plan a trip, it won’t help you create a poster or file your taxes. You’d still need multiple AI agents for different tasks. In a way, that’s no different from using different apps today. Sure, the interface might change from swiping and tapping to simply chatting. But the fragmentation remains. Unless a single, all-powerful agent comes along that can do it all, convenience will still come with trade offs.\nWhich is why this whole AI agent wave might help apps. Sure, they might feel the pressure to invest, innovate and offer better experiences to stay relevant. But that’s a good thing, right?\nUntil next time...\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we explore why India’s Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal, is nudging Indian startups to move beyond hyperfast grocery and food delivery and build deep tech startups.\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nLast week, at the Startup Mahakumbh, India’s Commerce Minister\nPiyush Goyal\nruffled a few feathers when he questioned the country’s startup ecosystem. He was particularly dismayed that too many founders are busy building things like fancy ice cream brands, 10-minute grocery apps or fantasy sports platforms. He did acknowledge that many of these startups have done well in terms of funding, user acquisition, job creation and even revenue and profitability. But in Goyal’s view, these consumer businesses were not exactly pushing the boundaries of innovation.\nHe even drew a contrast with China, where several new-age companies had successfully forayed into deep tech sectors like semiconductors, robotics, AI, 3D manufacturing and machine learning.\nSidebar: Deep tech refers to innovations founded on scientific or engineering advancements, often aiming to create a significant impact for society and, thereby, the economy.\nGetting back, Goyal wants Indians to not just focus on tech for convenience, but tech that solves complex problems and creates a long-term global economy through cutting-edge industries. So yeah, he believes that for India to become a true global tech powerhouse, its startups need to think bigger and deeper and ditch that low-hanging fruit.\nSo well, we thought, let’s analyse why he said so, and if the Indian startup ecosystem is truly lagging when it comes to new age technology and innovation.\nSee, over the past decade, China has quietly built a startup ecosystem that chases breakthroughs.\nTake AI, for instance. Chinese startup\nDeepSeek\nrecently grabbed global attention with an open-source AI model that’s reportedly on par with ChatGPT’s GPT-4. Then there’s\nSenseTime, Megvii and Yitu\n, AI unicorns powering everything from facial recognition at airports to surveillance. And mind you, these aren’t pet projects. These are deeply integrated into real-life use cases.\nIn semiconductors, despite intense US sanctions, China hasn’t slowed down. Startups like Biren Technology and Moore Threads are working on GPUs and AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia.\nHorizon Robotics\nis building AI chips specifically for self-driving vehicles. And Chinese firms reportedly spent over billions buying Nvidia’s advanced chips not just to use but to learn and build.\nEven in 3D manufacturing, companies like XtalPi, founded by Chinese MIT grads, are fusing quantum physics and AI to reduce the timeline for\ndrug development\nfrom 4 years to just 2.\nIn EVs and battery tech, Chinese companies aren’t just churning out electric cars. They’re building software-first, autonomous-ready vehicles. Behind the scenes, battery innovators are thriving, thanks to support from giants like CATL and BYD. Numerous countries in the world import electric cars and even EV batteries from China.\nOn the consumer side, Chinese startups have reimagined entire categories. WeChat became the blueprint for super apps. And TikTok rewrote how the world discovers content, with its algorithm-first design now copied globally. You might or might not remember Tiktok trolling Instagram when it launched ubiquitous ‘Reels’ in 2020: “Well... this looks familiar”.\nSo, if you look at China, it’s hard to argue with Goyal’s point.\nBut how did they manage to achieve so much, you might wonder?\nWell, it wasn’t overnight. Of course, with government support.\nIn 2015, the government picked key industries through its ‘Made in China 2025’ and then flooded these tech-startups with the support they needed. Its ‘14th Five-Year Plan’ starting in 2021, focused on sustainable development and tech advancements.\nWe’re talking about massive funding via government-led venture capital arms, dedicated tech parks with subsidised office space and shared R&D labs. And in many cases, the government itself acts as the first customer, buying deep tech products to kickstart adoption.\nIt wasn’t just support. It was state-led ecosystem building.\nTake semiconductors. In 2014, China launched its National Integrated Circuit Plan, pledging\nover $150 billion\nto reduce dependence on foreign chipmakers. But it wasn’t just about funding big-ticket players. The state stitched together the entire stack — from chip design institutes and fabs to talent pools and tax breaks for firms that used local chips.\nOr look at Zhongguancun, a suburb of Beijing that got a full makeover. With rent subsidies, patent support and easy access to public grants, it transformed into\nChina’s Silicon Valley\n, now home to the likes of Baidu, Xiaomi, Lenovo and a wave of AI and biotech startups.\nEven in electric vehicles, China didn’t just subsidise carmakers. It built charging infrastructure, offered license plate perks to EV owners, handed out cashback for R&D, and looped in battery majors like CATL and BYD, building a full-stack EV economy from scratch.\nAlso, the slashing of taxes and money spent by the Chinese government on R&D is worth praising. For instance, in 2024 alone, China slashed\n$361 billion\nin taxes and fees for high-tech firms, including $80.7 billion in R&D deductions. That same year, China’s total R&D spending hit $496 billion, compared to India’s $23.45 billion (₹20,000 crores) allocation to kickstart a private sector-led R&D fund under the FY25 Budget.\nIn fact, China’s 2024 tax revenues totalled a whopping\n17.5 trillion yuan\n(around ₹200 lakh crores). Just for context, that’s\nover 5 times\nwhat India earned in tax revenues that year. Now imagine funding massive deep tech innovation with a revenue that’s a fraction of China’s. If India truly wants to play in this league, it either has to drastically overhaul its taxation system, something Indian taxpayers might not be ready for, or find a way to expand its tax base. And that’s where things get tricky.\nYou see,\nbarely 5%\nof India’s population pays income tax. That’s a very small chunk carrying a very large burden. To increase this base, we need more jobs. But ironically, new tech is killing them. Akhil Gupta, former head of Blackstone India, recently\ntold CNBC\nthat AI is displacing jobs in India’s tech sector. And with unemployment already high, more productivity tools could end up worsening the situation. So it’s a bit of a vicious circle. Technology improves productivity, but that productivity ends up displacing jobs. And unless we create more labour and manufacturing jobs to balance it out, this loop could keep tightening.\nThe talent gap is also just as wide. China had 2.2 million R&D workers in 2022. That’s 2.5 times more than India’s.\nAnd while we often talk about becoming self-reliant or “Atmanirbhar”, it’s easier said than done. For years, we’ve been comfortable using products built by US tech giants. Shifting from that comfort zone and building our own alternatives will take not just willpower but deep capability. And frankly, we aren’t quite there yet.\nTake high-performance chips, for example — the kind used to train deep tech AI models. India doesn’t produce them. We rely on the US. And with recent export restrictions, even that reliance is now under pressure. The same story\nrepeats in other sectors\n, such as electronic components and active ingredients for pharmaceuticals.  We source a lot of it from China. So yes, wanting to be Atmanirbhar is great in spirit, but practically, we’re still caught in a web of external dependencies. Another vicious cycle.\nSure, the Indian government has announced a dedicated Fund of Funds for deeptech startups and a ₹10,000 crore “\nIndia AI Mission\n”, which it will spend over the next five years to step up the country’s AI capabilities apart from the ₹20,000 crores we mentioned earlier.\nBut that alone cannot ensure that we will truly be able to follow China’s path.\nFor that, we need innovative minds to take risks, and the government must offer strong support for these ventures to flourish and, hopefully, create a global footprint.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

But that’s the world of\ncoffee raves\n. From Amsterdam and New York to Indian cities, this sober-friendly trend is bubbling up fast. And here’s how it works — DJs spinning sunrise sets in cafés, baristas pulling espresso shots instead of cocktails, and crowds dancing to good vibes, all before breakfast or during sunset.\nNow, the idea isn’t entirely new to India. The model popped up briefly back in\n2018\n, probably thanks to expensive nightlife real estate and a rising curiosity around alternative party scenes. But it didn’t quite stick. Maybe the coffee culture hadn’t fully percolated yet, or partygoers weren’t quite ready to trade their tequila shots for caffeine highs.\nFast forward to now, and Gen Z’s craving for unique, Instagrammable, community-driven experiences has given it a second shot. Artists like DJ Tanishq are touring with More Coffee More Rave. And it’s doing a few good things. Cafés get more footfall. Artists get new gigs and a sober-friendly audience and even teenagers.

Not all cafés are built for acoustics, the novelty might wear off, and frequent parties might shoo away regulars who just want a quiet cup of joe.\nBut even if the format evolves, the appetite for fresh ways to “go out” is real. And India’s\ncoffee market\nis booming. Event culture is thriving. And for many, going out is no longer about getting drunk, it’s about feeling good.\nSo whether you're sober-curious, done with clubs, or just want to dance in the daylight — coffee raves might just be your new jam.\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nLong time no see\nby Taimour Baig\nYou can thank our reader Isha Sharma for this lyrical recommendation!\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nEarth’s pole is changing addresses\nWhat if we told you your Google Maps works thanks to a giant swirling ocean of molten iron beneath your feet? No, seriously. Because your phone’s compass (and pretty much every GPS system out there) depends on Earth’s magnetic field. And that magnetic field is powered by our planet’s spinning metal core.\nBut the thing is that this magnetic field isn’t fixed. In fact, the\nmagnetic north pole\nis drifting, and right now, it's sliding closer to Siberia.\nYou see, unlike the geographic North Pole, which stays put, magnetic north is a bit of a wanderer. Since it was first discovered in\n1831\nby British explorer James Clark Ross, it’s travelled thousands of kilometres. From Canada to Russia, and it’s been shifting faster in recent decades, drifting at around\n35 kilometres\na year!\nAnd if that feels too technical, you can think of Earth’s core like a massive pot of molten soup. As it churns, it creates invisible magnetic lines around the planet. And these lines help everything from birds and whales to ships, planes and yes, your Uber driver, figure out which way the North is.\nSo if our maps don’t keep up with this magnetic drift, things can go haywire. A few degrees off, and suddenly a plane’s autopilot might think it's flying toward Delhi when it’s supposed to land in Dubai.  A ship might misnavigate a port. Even your food delivery guy might take a few wrong turns.\nThat’s why scientists constantly update something called the World Magnetic Model (\nWMM\n). It’s like the GPS version of refreshing your Google Maps app but for the entire planet. That’s probably why it’s complicated and takes time, money, and a whole lot of data. Last year in December, they rolled out an update which will remain valid until late 2029. And the recent update comes with a super high-res version that’s more detailed, used in aviation, defence, and maritime industries. And over the next few years, companies will need to integrate this into their systems to stay on track.\nBut here's the wild part. Earth’s magnetic field has actually flipped in the past. Like a full-on reversal, where north becomes south and vice versa. The last one occurred around 780,000 years ago (known as the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal). The planet survived, of course. But humans weren’t around to see what happened to satellites, telecom networks, or marinelife.\nNow, we’re not saying a flip is coming tomorrow. But shifts are happening. And while AI-assisted recalibration and self-adjusting magnetometers are being tested, the best fix available right now is regular WMM model updates. Which GPS and tech teams across the world are working on as we speak. Because the longer we wait, the bigger the error in direction.\nSo next time your cab driver gets you somewhere or your pilot lands smoothly through dense clouds — remember, it’s not just tech. It’s also molten iron magic happening deep below, keeping our modern world on track.\nCrazy, yeah?\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\n1st of April, 1957 ― India’s coins transitioned to the decimal system\nOn this day, India decided to give its coinage system a makeover.\nBecause you see, before 1957, money in India was a bit of a maths puzzle. ₹1 wasn’t just 100 paise. It was split into 16 annas, and each anna into 4 pice. Not exactly easy to split a bill. This system was a colonial hangover and had been around for decades.\nSo in 1955, India decided to make things simpler.\nThe Coinage Act\nwas amended. And two years later, the decimal system kicked in. The rupee stayed the same, just split into 100 paise. These new coins were called “naye paise” (new paise), just to help people tell them apart from the older ones.\nSimple. Or so they thought.\nBut for a while, both old and new coins were in circulation, and people had to do conversions on the fly. A plate of idlis that earlier cost 4 annas (a quarter rupee) was now 25 naye paise. But many shopkeepers charged 26 paise instead.\nIf that made you go “why?”, well, it was partly because people were still wrapping their heads around the new system. Others rounded up out of habit or convenience. If something came to 25.25 paise, it was easier to round up to 26 paise. Some even used the confusion to their advantage, knowing most wouldn’t argue over a paisa.\nBut they were wrong. Arguments still broke out, especially in smaller towns where every paisa mattered. And that was understandable as one paisa could still get you peanuts or a front-row cinema seat back then!\nSo yeah, it took some time until people got used to the change. And it wasn’t until 1964 that the word “naya” was dropped. People had made peace with paise.\nOver the next couple of decades, smaller coins like 1, 2 and 3 paise quietly disappeared as rising prices made them practically worthless.\nFun fact: The quarter anna, a copper coin about the size of today’s ₹1, had a hole in the middle. That design was practically meant for stringing 64 coins together into a ₹1 garland! But when the coin eventually fell out of use, plumbers and mechanics got creative and repurposed them as washers to fix nuts and bolts. Now that’s some real jugaad!\nAnd that’s how India fully embraced its decimal journey.\nP.S. If this intrigued you, we recommend reading this beautifully written article, “\nThe Forgotten Anniversary of Decimalisation\n” by Vikram Doctor in The Economic Times.\nReaders Recommend 🗒️\nThis week, our reader Aashish Nuhani has a book recommendation for us.\nCoffee Can Investing\nby Saurabh Mukherjea, Rakshit Ranjan, Pranab Uniyal.\nAashish tells us that this book simplifies personal finance and goal-based investing. Jargons like ETFs and bonds suddenly start making sense. But what really stood out to him was the framework of categorising expenses into necessities, nice-to-haves, and luxuries — and then planning a portfolio of investments accordingly. It pushed him and his wife to rethink their portfolio and realign their financial goals.

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we talk about why the world is running out of helium and why that’s a much bigger problem than it sounds.\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nWhat’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of helium? Probably party balloons, right? The ones that float up into the sky. But once they burst, that helium leaks into the atmosphere, drifts up and eventually escapes into space. It’s gone. Forever.\nAnd that’s what makes helium so unique – and problematic. To understand why, let’s take it from the top.\nHelium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the universe. But the catch is that it’s exceedingly rare on Earth. That’s because it’s an inert gas (so it doesn’t easily bond with other elements in chemical reactions) and incredibly light (so it floats away quickly). So when you combine those two traits, you’ve got a gas that’s nearly impossible to hold on to.\nIn fact, we didn’t even know helium existed on Earth until 1895. Scientists had only detected it in the Sun’s spectrum, which is why it’s named after Helios, the Greek god of the Sun. But when British chemist William Ramsay\nisolated it\nfrom uranium ore, it became clear that this solar element was hiding on earth too, but just in very small quantities.\nAnd for a while, nobody thought much of this discovery. But that changed during World War I when the US realised it could be used in\nairships\nas a safer alternative to hydrogen. For context, hydrogen is highly flammable – one small spark, and the entire airship could go up in flames. But with helium, it was a perfect eureka moment. And by the time World War II came about, helium had become a military essential, used in rocket propulsion and to cool nuclear reactors.\nStill, helium was rare. So how did it become so widely available as we can see today, you ask?\nWell, it all goes back to the US. At the start of the 20th century, drillers in the\nUS state of Kansas\nhit a rich natural gas deposit. But the gas just wouldn’t ignite. That’s when the scientists analysed it and found out that the gas reserves contained an unusually high amount of helium. And that set off a new realisation: Helium wasn’t just in the skies or exotic minerals; it was hiding right under our feet, trapped in underground pockets mixed with natural gas. And from there, the US raced ahead. For nearly a century, it dominated global helium production, thanks to its Texas-based Helium Reserve – the world’s largest helium stockpile.\nFast forward to today, and you can see helium powering a surprising range of critical industries. Take healthcare, for instance. MRI machines rely on liquid helium to cool their superconducting magnets. Quantum computers need helium to reach temperatures close to absolute zero. Then there’s the semiconductor industry, where gas plays a crucial role in plasma etching, cooling, and purging contaminants. Even the space industry depends on it as rockets use helium to pressurise fuel tanks, and satellite instruments need it for cooling. It’s also a lifesaver for deep-sea divers, who use a mixture of 80% helium and 20% Oxygen to breathe under high-pressure conditions. And yeah, it’s at your supermarket checkouts, too: the helium-neon gas lasers in barcode scanners wouldn’t work without it.\nSo yeah, it’s everywhere. The only problem is that its reserves are limited and we’re running out of it!\nBecause for one, helium is non-renewable. Once extracted and used, it eventually escapes. And we can’t artificially produce it. Second, its supply is highly concentrated. The\nUS, Qatar, and Algeria\ncontrol most of it. But with US reserves depleting and geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains, there’s a serious bottleneck.\nAnd demand is booming. Helium demand is expected to nearly\ndouble by 2035\n, especially due to the semiconductor boom driven by AI and advanced computing. And since helium has no viable alternatives for heat management in semiconductor manufacturing, demand could skyrocket and so might the prices.\nAnd this worry isn’t limited to high-tech industries. The helium shortage is now threatening something as basic as\nweather forecasting\n. Weather balloons, which carry specialised sensors to collect vital data on temperature, wind, and humidity, rely on helium. But the US National Weather Service has started scaling back balloon launches due to the shortage. And that could reduce forecasting accuracy and lead to less warning ahead of severe weather events.\nAnd in India, we rely entirely on imports for helium, making us exposed to price fluctuations and supply disruptions. So if the tap runs dry, industries like healthcare, electronics, space research and AI could face setbacks.\nBut there’s a glimmer of hope.\nIn 2016, massive helium reserves were discovered in Tanzania – an estimated\n54 billion cubic feet (bcf)\n, enough to fill over a million medical MRI scanners. And later assessments suggest the real number could be much higher. Just last month, Tanzania granted its first-ever helium mining license to\nHelium One Global\n. If all goes well, production could start soon, offering the world a new supply lifeline.\nIn the meantime, countries are scrambling. Some are stockpiling helium in strategic reserves. Others are investing in helium recycling — especially for MRI machines and other medical uses. And researchers are testing alternative gases where possible.\nBut for now, the bottom line is that until new sources are online and recycling becomes widespread, we need to use helium like the precious resource it is. Because once it’s gone, it’s not coming back.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nEvery day before you start to get work done you rely on something essential without even realising it. It powered the cab you took to work, heated the water in your shower, lit the stove in your kitchen and even helped grow the vegetables on your plate.\nWe’re talking about natural gas.\nAnd we’re talking about it because it’s about to get pricier. From this month (April 2025) the government has tweaked natural gas’ price calculation, marking the first hike in two years. To understand why, let’s take it from the top.\nLook, natural gas is mostly methane (CH4). It burns cleaner than other fossil fuels and is incredibly versatile. It’s used in transportation, cooking gas, to power industries like ceramics and steel and making fertilisers essential to Indian agriculture. But despite this, it only accounts for\n6%\nof India’s total energy consumption. And India wants to triple this share to 15% by 2030. But since we’re not there yet, we import\nabout 50%\nof our gas, mostly as liquefied natural gas (LNG). And that’s where things get tricky. Importing LNG means we’re constantly at the mercy of global price shocks.\nTake 2020, for example. ONGC, India’s biggest gas producer back then, was selling natural gas at\n$2.39 per MMBTU\neven though it cost them $3.70 to extract it. Basically, they were bleeding money on every unit they sold. And other gas producers were in the same boat.\nSidebar: MMBTU stands for “million British Thermal Units”. It’s just a fancy way of measuring energy content. You’ll see this unit a lot when anyone talks about gas prices.\nThe reason was simple. Regulation. You see, domestic gas prices weren’t market driven but were based on a formula averaging global prices from the US, Canada, the UK and Russia. Every six months, the government would average those prices, do the math and set a new rate. So when global prices crashed during the pandemic, the formula dragged Indian prices down too. For context, in October 2020, domestic gas was priced at just\n$1.79\nper MMBTU.\nThen came the bounce back. As economies reopened, gas demand surged. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, prices spiralled. Europe scrambled to replace Russian gas, turning to LNG. And just like that,\nspot LNG prices in Asia\nwent through the roof, touching $70 per mmBtu at one point. And again, India, increasingly dependent on imports, was caught in the crossfire. Thanks to the pricing formula which either passed on high prices to consumers or made it unviable for producers to sustain.\nThat’s when the government called in the Dr. Kirit Parikh panel to fix it. And the\nnew formula\n, introduced in April 2023, simplified things. Domestic gas would now be priced at 10% of the Indian crude oil basket, instead of being benchmarked to distant gas surplus countries. There was a floor price of $4 to protect producers and a cap of $6.50 to shield consumers. From April 2025, the cap could rise 4% annually until gas prices are fully deregulated in 2027. It was a Goldilocks solution ― not too high, not too low. ONGC and Oil India finally stopped losing money. City gas distributors like GAIL, IGL and MGL got price stability. And consumers were shielded from global volatility.\nAnd now, we’re seeing the next step in action. The government has raised the cap for the first time in two years ― from $6.50 to\n$6.75 per MMBTU\n, exactly as scheduled. And while a 4% hike may not sound like much, it adds up.\nHow?\nWell, upstream producers like ONGC benefit as they earn more per unit. But city gas distributors, who supply CNG (compressed natural gas) and PNG (piped natural gas), may have to pass on the higher costs. Industrial users will see bigger bills. Fertiliser companies will demand more subsidies. And the government will have to make room for it in an already tight budget.\nBut this hike isn’t happening in isolation. Global gas prices are rising again too. And there’s a bunch of things that are driving the rise.\nFor one, there’s\nextreme weather\n. Droughts in China, heatwaves in Europe and cold snaps in the US either spike demand (more heating or cooling) or cripple supply of hydro or wind power. And when renewables fall short, guess what fills the gap? Yup, natural gas.\nThen there’s the surge in LNG exports from major producers like the US, Qatar and Australia. Sure, increased LNG exports may seem like a good thing as it boosts global supply. But it actually tightens the spot market where gas is bought and sold for immediate delivery. Countries with long term contracts (fixed-price deals for a set period) benefit from stable prices. However, countries like India, which rely partly on spot market purchases, face higher and more volatile prices since the demand for LNG keeps the market thin and competitive.\nAnd finally, there’s currency depreciation. India pays for LNG in dollars. With the dollar hovering around ₹85, even stable dollar prices translate to higher costs in rupee terms. Basically, a weak currency makes everything imported more expensive. That’s why many gas marketing companies are calling for pricing domestic gas\nin rupees\ninstead of dollars.\nPut all of these together and these challenges make India’s natural gas ambitions a tightrope walk. Domestic prices aren’t always in sync with global trends, causing trouble for producers and the government alike.\nSo, what’s the way out, you ask?\nWell, for starters, India is trying to hedge its bets. We’re boosting domestic production. Oil marketing companies are expanding their natural gas businesses. Companies are signing long term LNG contracts to avoid volatile spot markets. We’re building more LNG terminals, pipelines and city gas networks to expand access. And we’re also exploring alternatives like ethanol blended fuel, electric vehicles and even green hydrogen.\nBut the road ahead is long. India’s gas output has been mostly flat for years while demand keeps rising. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that India’s natural gas demand will\nrise 60%\nby 2030. And limited domestic production means that by the end of this decade, LNG imports will need to more than double to 65 billion cubic metres (bcm) annually to keep up. To top it off, expanding infrastructure is capital intensive and comes with regulated price swings.\nSo even in the best case, we can’t become self sufficient anytime soon.\nThat said, India can learn from other countries.\nJapan\n, the world’s second largest LNG importer, for example, is moving towards pooling supplies and enabling cargo swaps with South Korea and Italy to bring more flexibility in prices, instead of rigid long-term deals.\nBrazil\nhas scaled up ethanol-powered vehicles.\nEurope\nis diversifying LNG exports as well as increasing its renewable energy investments. And the US is now the world’s top gas producer with massive shale gas exploration technology.\nWhile it’s true that India can’t replicate all of these models, we can still move faster on the basics — boosting domestic supply, refining pricing mechanisms and investing in smarter infrastructure.\nBecause the bottom line is that India desperately wants gas to power its clean energy future. But gas itself is getting pricier, messier and more unpredictable. So yeah, the real challenge isn’t just using more of it, it’s managing it better.\nAnd this little 4% hike in April? Maybe it’s a reminder that the age of cheap, predictable gas might be behind us.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nWe’re back with another gold story. And why not? Gold prices have hit an all-time high, smashing records left and right. Yesterday, it touched a jaw dropping\n$3,145\nper troy ounce (about 31.1 grams) in the US, while in India, it soared to ₹91,300 per 10 grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).\nBut why is gold on fire?\nWell, blame it on Trump’s tariff threats. Markets are panicking over what these tariffs could do to global trade, and fears of an impending trade war have everyone running to the safest asset in history ― gold.\nSee, gold isn’t like money that central banks can print endlessly. It’s a finite resource. To put things in perspective, so far, around\n2.16 lakh tonnes\nor 80% of all economically extractable gold has already been mined. And just about 54,000 tonnes are left buried underground. And when something becomes scarce, it only gets more valuable. That’s why, in times of economic turmoil, everyone from governments and central banks to big investors and folks like you and me rushes to hoard gold.\nBut guess who doesn’t buy into this shiny obsession?\nWarren Buffett!\nYup, the legendary investor has never been a fan of gold, and probably never will be, no matter how high its price climbs. Because gold simply doesn’t fit into his playbook.\nYou see, Buffett’s a\nvalue investor\n, someone who hunts for assets priced lower than their true worth, expecting the market to catch up and price them right eventually. But gold for him, is an unproductive asset. Unlike stocks, which generate profits and dividends, and have a company behind them that sells goods and services through some value creation, gold just… sits there. It doesn’t grow, innovate or pay you back in any way. Neither is it anything like its cousin\nsilver\n, which at least, has industrial applications. It goes into your gadgets and even electric vehicle batteries. But gold has little utility beyond being shiny and desirable.\nBuffett explained it beautifully in his\n2011 letter\nto Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders. He painted a simple picture:\nImagine a giant cube made of all the gold in the world. It would weigh about 170,000 metric tons and have a value of $9.6 trillion. Now, for that same amount of money, you could buy all the farmland in the US (400 million acres generating $200 billion annually), 16 ExxonMobils (then the most profitable company in the world), and still have a trillion dollars in cash left over. A century from now, that farmland would have produced massive amounts of crops, ExxonMobil would have paid trillions in dividends, and yet… the gold cube would remain unchanged, doing nothing. Sure, you can touch it, admire it, even hoard it, but it won’t make you money.\nBut then you could argue that gold is undervalued and never holds the same price over time. For instance, if we valued gold the old-school way, like when the\nUS dollar was backed by it\n, its fair price today would be much higher. Sure, we don’t follow that system anymore, but if you just used it as a\nbenchmark\n, you’d notice something interesting. The US Federal Reserve’s total M2 money supply stands at around\n$21.6 trillion\n. Think of M2 money supply as all the money that’s easily accessible in an economy but also includes some savings that aren’t immediately available for spending. Meanwhile, the US government holds approximately\n261 million troy ounces\nof gold (the largest among central banks worldwide). If you do the math, gold’s fair price should be around $75,000 an ounce, suggesting that it’s undervalued by 95% at today’s price.\nSounds crazy, right?\nBut there’s a flaw here, which we’ve already told you about at the start. Unlike gold, money isn’t limited. Governments can print as much as they want. So, pegging gold’s value to money supply is like using a moving target.\nAnd that begs the question: If gold doesn’t generate income and might not be undervalued, why does its price keep rising?\nWell, the short answer is fear.\nPeople invest in gold because they’re scared. Scared of inflation, recessions, wars and financial meltdowns. They don’t buy gold for what it does. They buy it hoping that someone else will be willing to pay more for it later. It’s eerily similar to the famous\nTulip Mania\nof the 1600s. This was one of the first financial bubbles recorded in history where tulips became a status symbol, and demand skyrocketed, driving prices to absurd levels even as much as 10 times an average person’s annual salary! People kept investing in tulips, believing that the hype would never end. Until it did. Prices collapsed overnight and many were left in financial ruin.\nGold, of course, has endured through history, but the idea remains the same. It rises because people expect more uncertainty in the future than they have today. It acts as an asset of trust because people have believed in its value for centuries and continue to hope it will hold its value in the years to come.\nAlso, let’s not forget that owning gold isn’t free. You need to pay for storage, insurance and security. Those extra costs eat into your returns over time.\nAnd if you’re still not convinced you could look at its long term returns. If you had invested ₹1 lakh in gold in 1995, by 2024, it would be worth ₹16.5 lakhs. But if you had put that same ₹1 lakh into the BSE SENSEX, you’d have a sweet₹25 lakhs today! The same goes for the S&P 500, which has outpaced gold over time.\nOkay, but then why do people still rush to gold?\nWell, according to an interesting observation by\nEquitymaster\n, it’s all about ‘recency bias’. Basically, while stock market indices have outperformed gold over time, in the last year alone, gold has delivered a solid 29% return, which is three times what the SENSEX managed.\nAnd that again neatly ties into Buffett’s point too. Gold investing is often driven by fear, not logic. Since the pandemic, both the fear-driven buying of gold and its value have surged. First in 2020, then after the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, and now with fresh geopolitical tensions. And people focus on recent gains rather than long term performance. So it’s no surprise that it’s grabbing attention!\nBut does that mean that you should avoid gold completely just because Buffett does?\nNot really. Because gold can be a useful hedge against inflation, just not the perfect one.\nSo yeah, even though Warren Buffett isn’t a fan of gold, adding a small chunk of gold to your portfolio isn’t really a bad idea. But going all in just because it looks shiny is probably not the best thing to do.\nUntil next time…\nCorrection:\nAn earlier version of this story measured gold in ounces (28.35 grams). However, the standard unit for precious metals like gold and silver is always troy ounces (31.1 grams). We regret the error and have now corrected it. So, if you see “ounce” anywhere in the story, just know we mean troy ounce.\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we discuss the economics of Risdiplam and why a pharma battle around the drug raises concerns about the industry’s ethics.\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nLet’s start today’s story with a sensitive hypothetical situation. Imagine someone in India suffering from a rare genetic disease. And for years, there’s been no cure. But one day, like magic, a foreign pharmaceutical company develops a breakthrough treatment. It patents the drug and begins selling it in India.\nBut here’s the catch. The medicine costs a bomb. Unable to afford it, the patient slowly suffers and, eventually, passes away.\nWhat you just read, dear folks, isn’t an imaginary example or an isolated one. It’s the reality for\n1 in 7,700 people\nborn in India. In fact, as you read this, around 4,000 Indians are battling Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare\ngenetic disorder\nthat affects the nerves. For the uninitiated, the normal human body needs a protein called SMN (survival motor neuron) to perform basic functions like moving, swallowing and even breathing. But in SMA patients, the body doesn’t produce enough of it, leading to a lifetime of struggle.\nAnd since diseases don’t discriminate based on financial status, many patients never get the treatment they need. That said, SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant deaths in India. What’s even worse is that 1 in 38 people unknowingly carry the faulty gene responsible for it.\nIn 2021 though, a ray of hope emerged ― a drug called Risdiplam, sold as Evrysdi by Swiss pharma giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (we’ll just call it Roche from here on). It helped SMA patients produce more of the SMN protein, allowing them to manage their condition better, even if it wasn’t a complete cure.\nThe only problem? A year’s supply of Evrysdi costs anywhere between\n₹20 lakhs\nand ₹70 lakhs. That’s because each bottle is priced at around ₹2 lakhs, and patients need at least 30 bottles annually to efficiently manage their condition. While that’s\ncheaper\nthan alternatives like Zolgensma, a gene therapy which costs a staggering ₹17 crores, or even Nusinersen, a drug priced at ₹87 lakhs, Evrysdi is still the most affordable option yet out of reach for most.\nThat’s what Natco Pharma, an Indian company, wanted to change. It wanted to manufacture Risdiplam at a fraction of the cost to make it accessible.\nBut maybe you’ve already guessed that this didn’t sit well with Roche. After all, its patent for Risdiplam is valid until May 2035, meaning no one else can manufacture it commercially without permission. Natco, however, went ahead anyway. So Roche dragged it to court, asking to block what it saw as a patent violation.\nBut here’s the twist. A few days ago, the Delhi High Court refused to block Natco from launching its version of the drug. In the\ncourt’s own words\n:\nThe approved drug, i.e., Risdiplam, which is marketed under the name Evrysdi, is not available at reasonably affordable prices in India. Thus, if a party is able to manufacture the drug and make it available at an affordable price, in such a case, the public interest would have to outweigh the need for grant of injunction.\nAt this point, you’re probably thinking, “But hey, isn’t this unfair to companies that invest millions in researching and developing life saving drugs?”\nAnd you wouldn’t be wrong.\nBut then you have to understand why Roche couldn’t fully stop Natco from breaking into the market.\nSee, pharma companies spend years researching and developing new treatments, pouring in enormous sums of money to find a cure. So when they finally succeed, they safeguard their innovation fiercely and price their drugs high to recover those massive R&D costs. That’s exactly why Evrysdi comes with such a hefty price tag.\nOn top of that, the market for the drug is tiny. Only a handful of people need it. So Roche prices it steeply, trying to maximise profits before its patent expires. Because once a generic drug maker steps in, the monopoly vanishes, and so do the sky high profits.\nBut look at the economics of Risdiplam, and you’ll see why Roche’s case isn’t as strong. The actual cost of producing a bottle of Evrysdi including active ingredients, packaging and even a 20% profit margin could be\nas low as ₹3,000\n. Even if Roche added a whopping 1,000% profit margin, it could still sell the drug in India at a 99% discount to its US price ($11,170 or roughly ₹9.5 lakh per bottle). And that actually raises ethical concerns. Is Roche making a fair profit, or is it exploiting desperate patients?\nThen, there’s the larger debate about patent laws and access to medicines in India.\nBefore 1970\n, India only granted patents on the process of making a drug, not the drug itself. This allowed Indian pharma companies to reverse engineer and produce affordable generic (copied versions) medicines. That’s also how India became the “Pharmacy of the World”, supplying low cost medicines globally.\nBut things changed in 1995 when India signed the\nTRIPS Agreement\n(Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) under the WTO (World Trade Organization). By 2005, Indian patent laws were put at par with global standards, meaning companies could no longer manufacture or sell patented drugs for 20 years without the patent holder’s consent.\nBut then TRIPS also included exceptions known as\nTRIPS flexibilities\n. These ensure that public health isn’t compromised, especially when it comes to affordable medicines. And here are three key ones that matter:\nCompulsory licensing\n: In cases where a patented drug is either too expensive or fails to meet public demand, pharma companies can legally manufacture a generic version without the patent holder’s consent. This was seen in the 2013 Natco Pharma vs. Bayer Corporation case, where Natco was granted permission to produce a more affordable version of Bayer’s cancer drug.\nNo patent evergreening\n: Pharma giants can’t extend a patent’s life by making minor tweaks to a drug unless they prove that the changes significantly improve its efficacy. This prevents companies from holding onto patents indefinitely and blocking generic alternatives. A good example is the 2013 Novartis case, where the company tried to extend its patent on Glivec, an anti-cancer drug, but was denied.\nParallel imports\n: If a drug costs $100 in Sweden but sells for $200 in India, Indian pharma companies (or even the government) can import the cheaper version without the patent holder’s approval. This ensures that life saving drugs aren’t priced out of reach simply because of geography.\nThese flexibilities exist to strike a balance so that pharma companies get due credit for their innovation, but life saving treatments don’t remain exclusive only to those who can afford them.\nAnd as we’ve explained earlier, the court weighed these factors in the Roche vs. Natco case and sided with public interest. It acknowledged that Evrysdi was financially out of reach for most SMA patients and also caught Roche trying to unfairly extend its monopoly by using an unfair tactic called “evergreening”. Evergreening, or forever patenting, is when companies extend their patent rights by filing a new patent on an existing drug after making minor tweaks without actually improving its effectiveness. The court saw through this because Roche’s own patent filings in the US, Australia and Canada suggested that Risdiplam was already part of an earlier patent. And if Roche had filed for the original patent in India, it would have expired much sooner.\nAnd finally, there’s India’s Patents Act (of 2005), which gives the government\nthe power\nto step in and allow generic drug production when it’s in the public’s best interest.\nSo, when the court refused to rule in Roche’s favour, it wasn’t about India\nundervaluing patents\n. It was about ethics. It was about whether foreign pharma giants should be allowed to squeeze Indian markets dry while leaving little room for Indian companies to step in.\nOf course, global pharma firms don’t see it that way. Companies like Novartis have already voiced concerns over India’s patent laws, even\nshifting\nresearch centres to Singapore and China, fearing their intellectual property isn’t safe here. They argue that India isn’t letting them innovate.\nBut here’s the real question. Are they innovating for the greater good, or are they just running businesses designed to squeeze abnormal profits out of vulnerable people?\nWe’ll leave you with that thought.\nUntil next time…\nBut before you go you should also know that Roche isn’t out of options yet. It can still\nappeal\nthe Delhi High Court’s decision, and if it wins, it could claim damages too. So until the case reaches a final verdict, the court has put the brakes on Natco’s plans to roll out its generic version of Risdiplam.\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

We simplify business and finance for 5,00,000+ readers every day, and now, we’re looking for someone who can break down market trends, economic policies and business stories into crisp, engaging reads.\nIf this sounds like you, or you know someone who’d be perfect for the role,\napply here\nor share it with them.\nAlso, if you love to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance,\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nBluSmart, once the blue-eyed child of the cab ride-hailing world, is now facing its toughest challenge since its inception in 2019.\nLast week, its top brass, the\nCEO, CBO, CTO and VP\n(Chief Executive Officer, Chief Business Officer, Chief Technology Officer and Vice President) put down their papers and moved through the exit doors. While the company threw\nspeculation about Uber\nacquiring it straight out the window, one thing is clear: clouds of troubles are looming.\nAnd to think, not too long ago, people were celebrating BluSmart, sharing words of appreciation in LinkedIn posts for the quality of service it offered. Investors like BP Ventures and Mayfield India Fund were all in, too. A Zurich-based climate finance firm even poured\n$24 million\ninto the company about a year ago. So, yeah, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that things were going off without a hitch for BluSmart.\nSo then what went wrong, you ask?\nWell, let’s take it from the top.\nSee, BluSmart set itself apart by going all-in on electric vehicles (EVs) and positioning itself as the sustainable alternative to Ola and Uber. But there was one key difference in their business models. Ola and Uber relied on drivers who owned or financed their own cars, keeping the financial burden off their balance sheets. BluSmart, on the other hand, had to lease EVs from leasing companies or third-party financiers, exposing it to significant financial risk. Think about it. If leasing costs went up or its leasing partners pulled back, its entire fleet and business model could be at risk.\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\nAt the centre of the storm is Anmol Singh Jaggi, who founded both Gensol Engineering, a public company focused on solar energy and EV leasing and BluSmart, a privately owned EV cab service. But here’s where things get tricky. Gensol wasn’t just any EV leasing company. It secured government-backed loans from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to\npurchase thousands of EVs\n, most of which ended up in BluSmart’s fleet. Essentially, government-backed money meant for Gensol indirectly fuelled BluSmart’s expansion, with IREDA’s knowledge, of course.\nBut there was another layer to this relationship. Gensol’s FY24 annual report disclosed contracts worth over\n₹148 crores with BluSmart’s subsidiaries\n, raising questions about just how intertwined the two companies really were.\nThe problem? While BluSmart thrived, Gensol’s public investors weren’t directly benefitting because BluSmart wasn’t a Gensol subsidiary. It remained a separate private entity. Plus, Gensol wasn’t exactly transparent about how much money was flowing into BluSmart.\nBluSmart argued that all these deals were fair and independent, conducted at arm’s length and approved by the board. But with the companies closely tied, questions about corporate governance started to pop up.\nThen came the real blow. By the end of 2024, Gensol had unpaid loans of\n₹470 crores towards IREDA\n. As a result, credit ratings agencies, including CARE and ICRA downgraded Gensol’s debt to default status, accusing it of hiding key financial details. And that naturally sent Gensol’s stock price nosediving, forcing the company to make a tough call.\nIt had to eventually decide to sell off nearly 3,000 EVs to Refex Green Mobility to cut its debt. But then,\nRefex called off that deal\na few days ago, which has put BluSmart in deeper trouble. It has to find a different way out to pare its debt.\nAnd with Gensol out of the picture, BluSmart is also struggling to raise funds.\nBut there’s another question here: Did BluSmart get an unfair advantage all along?\nSee, the thing is that with Gensol financing its expansion and providing cars, BluSmart had a relatively easy ride. But now that its closest ally is gone, it has little leverage in securing favourable lease terms. And with its losses mounting to\n₹215 crores in FY23\nalong with mounting complaints from poor customer service, things are getting tougher.\nAlthough BluSmart says that it has diversified its leasing partnerships with\nOrix, Kinto and Mahindra & Mahindra\n, however, with over a third of its fleet coming from Gensol, which is now out of the equation, its ability to scale independently is in question.\nSo this was the long and short of it.\nAll things aside, at the heart of it all lies a broader entrepreneurial lesson.\nAs\nSundeep Khanna from Mint\npointed out about Gensol and BluSmart, as a cautionary tale of spreading too thin. In easy terms, expanding into related businesses can fuel innovation and create operational synergies. But when companies diversify into entirely unrelated sectors, things can go downhill fast.\nIn this case, running two capital-intensive businesses, EV leasing and ride-hailing, may have stretched Anmol Singh Jaggi beyond his limits.\nThe lesson here is diversification works best when businesses stay within their circle of competence. Unrelated expansions may look lucrative at first, but they often lead to governance lapses, financial mismanagement and, ultimately, a house of cards waiting to collapse. (We must also note that this theory may not always hold true!)\nThat said, we’re not here to pass verdicts. Gensol could still be cleared of any wrongdoing. But the damage is already done. Gensol’s stock has tanked, BluSmart is scrambling, and investors are questioning the business model itself.\nSo now, the question remains. Can BluSmart truly stand on its own, or was it always just riding on borrowed time?\nOnly time will tell.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n.\nNote: An earlier version of this story wrongly mentioned that Gensol Engineering had sold nearly 3,000 EVs to Refex Engineering. But the deal was still a work in progress and was called off on 28th March 2025. We regret the error and have now corrected the story to reflect the changes."

                    "content": "Hey folks!\nImagine you’ve got a brilliant idea for an app, but there’s just one problem. You don’t know a thing about coding. Hiring a developer sounds expensive, and suddenly, your excitement crashes before it even takes off.\nBut what if you could build that app without writing a single line of code? Enter vibe coding, a term that’s taken the internet by storm.\nCoined by\nAndrej Karpathy\n, co-founder of OpenAI and former AI lead at Tesla, vibe coding is all about “fully giving in to the vibes” and “forgetting that the code even exists”. In simple terms, it means you tell an AI model like ChatGPT, Claude or Copilot what you want in plain English, and it spits out the code for you. You test it, tweak it and just like that, you’re a programmer!\nSounds like magic, right? Well, that’s why the internet is buzzing about whether mid-level engineers are doomed. It’s kind of like how GPT-4o, OpenAI’s latest image generation model,\nmade everyone a designer\novernight.\nBut hold on. Knowing how to code isn’t just about typing lines of code on a screen. It’s about understanding how things work underneath. Think of it like this. Back in the 1990s, turning on a desktop was a process. You had to power up the CPU, switch on the monitor and connect to dial-up internet. You learned how everything fit together. And over time, this basic knowledge helped you navigate everything from defragmenting hard drives to figuring out the difference between WordPad and Microsoft Word.\nNow, fast forward to today. Our parents are pros at scrolling social media and forwarding WhatsApp messages. But explain to them that their phone storage is full because of those “Good Morning” or “Good Night” picture messages, and suddenly, you’re met with confusion. “But I didn’t download anything!” they’ll say.\nWithout understanding the mechanics, even simple fixes become impossible. Just ask my dad. He somehow has five Facebook accounts, none of which he can access (password forgotten, no phone number linked for password recovery), and he wants me to magically delete the extra accounts.\nThe same logic applies to vibe coding. AI can churn out code, but if something goes wrong, it won’t magically fix itself because it’s the model that made this mistake in the first place. You need to know\nhow to troubleshoot\n. So, while vibe coding sounds revolutionary, engineers aren’t going anywhere just yet.\nMaybe AI’s got the vibes, but human expertise still runs the show for now!\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nDekho Na\nby Raman Sharma\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nHow goli soda became a global hero\nRemember goli soda? That local fizzy drink in a quirky glass bottle sealed with a marble? You just had to push the marble down, and “pop” it went!\nDrinking it today sure feels like a rush of nostalgia in every sip.\nBut guess what? It’s gone global!\nRebranded as “\nGoli Pop Soda\n”, this iconic Indian beverage has made its way to the US, UK, Europe and the Gulf. A partnership with Fair Exports India even secured its spot in Lulu Hypermarket, where it’s flying off the shelves.\nBut hey, wasn’t goli soda\nnearly wiped out\nby the likes of Coca Cola and Pepsi in the late 1990s? Bottling costs soared, hygiene concerns scared people away and the desi favourite slowly fizzled out.\nSo how did it stage a comeback, that too on a global scale, you ask?\nWell, the answer lies in reinvention.\nFor context, goli soda (aka goti soda or banta soda) dates back to British India, packaged in codd-neck bottles that were first imported from Britain before being made locally. Street vendors, called “bantawalas”, turned it into a cultural staple, selling flavoured sodas on roadside carts.\nBut then, multinational soda giants entered the Indian market and shook things up. Their aggressive marketing made survival tough for local goli soda makers. For context, the iconic codd-neck bottles alone made up a whopping\n96%\nof production costs, squeezing profits dry. And eventually, the beloved desi fizz faded away.\nThen, in 2017, something unexpected happened — the Jallikattu protests in Tamil Nadu. For the uninitiated, these were youth-led protests pushing to lift the Supreme Court’s ban on Jallikattu, a centuries old Tamil Nadu tradition where participants try to grab and tame a bull as it charges through the crowd. As people rallied to protect their cultural heritage, all things local saw a resurgence. And goli soda was one of them.\nSensing an opportunity, entrepreneurs stepped in. They swapped glass bottles for cost effective plastic ones, improved hygiene with extra protective seals and introduced trendy flavours like passion fruit, blueberry and mojito alongside classics like jeera and lemon. The nostalgic charm, paired with modern upgrades, struck a chord, not just in India but globally too.\nSales have doubled over the last five years, proving that nostalgia actually sells.\nBut here’s the bittersweet part. While goli soda thrives in its premium avatar, the “bantawalas” who made it an icon have faded into history.\nAnd that makes us think: Premiumisation is in, but at what cost?\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\n30th of March, 1867 ― The US bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million\nOn this day, US Secretary of State William H Seward and Russian envoy Baron Edouard de Stoeckl sealed a deal called the\nTreaty of Cession\n, that redrew the world map overnight. And just like that, Alaska, once a distant Russian region, became part of the US.\nToday, Alaska is literally a goldmine, rich in oil, fish and minerals. Plus, its strategic location gives the US a front row seat to the Arctic while keeping an eye on its old Cold War rival, Russia.\nBut why did Russia sell it in the first place?\nWell, the short answer is Britain.\nConfused? Let’s explain.\nBack in the 18th century, a Danish explorer, originally sailing for Russia, accidentally reached Alaska. And his crew discovered a treasure trove. No, we’re not talking about gold, but sea otters. Their fur was all the rage in international markets. And soon, this led to Russian traders moving in and dominating both Alaska and the fur trade. By the end of the 18th century, the then Russian emperor granted a\nRussian-American company\na monopoly over Alaska’s fur trade, effectively making it an official Russian territory.\nBut governing this icy land was no easy feat. It was sparsely populated, far from Moscow and nearly impossible to defend.\nThen came the Crimean War, where Russia found itself locked in battle with Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. The war drained Russia’s finances and exposed its military weaknesses. To make matters worse, Britain, which controlled Canada, was an ever-growing threat.\nRussia feared\nthat if war broke out again, Alaska might fall into British hands, without a single ruble in return.\nSo, rather than risk losing it for nothing, Russia sold it to a friendly power, one that also happened to be Britain’s rival, the US.\nYup, we know it’s crazy. But back then, Russia and the US\nwere actually allies\n. And that unlikely friendship is exactly how Alaska ended up on the American map.\nP.S.: Fast forward to today, imagine if Trump’s dream of buying Greenland or even absorbing Canada ever came true.

Sounds exciting, right?\nWell, last week, American pharma giant Eli Lilly made waves by launching Tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro) in India, a powerful new drug that helps with both diabetes and weight loss. And with over 100 million Indians living with diabetes and another 70 million battling obesity, this could be a game changer.\nBut there’s a catch.

That’s a steep price to pay.\nSo then how does this weight loss revolution actually hold promise for Indian patients? Find out in our\nMonday’s newsletter\n.\nTrump wants European eggs, but what about tariffs?\nThe US president is in awe of tariffs. And soon after he took office, he slapped a slew of tariffs on almost all of his major trading partners, including the European Union (EU). And in response, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US. So yes, it’s a full-blown tariff war. “You tax our imports? Guess what? We tax your products. We’re even now.”\nHowever, as great an economic tool as tariffs might seem at first, they have always backfired.

And why’s that, you ask?\nWell, because the dating app business isn’t exactly swiping right on growth anymore. Weaker than expected earnings have sent stocks of companies like Match Group, the parent of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and more, tumbling nearly 80% from their 2021 peak.\nSo, what’s going wrong in the world of dating apps?

However, the problem starts when these waste tyres find their way into illegal, unlicensed pyrolysis plants that are burgeoning in numerous parts of the country.\nIn these makeshift plants, tyres are heated in an oxygen-free environment, releasing a cocktail of toxins that are highly carcinogenic.\nAnd guess what? The UK’s regulations for exporting these worn-out tyres are extremely lax. Pyrolysis plant owners extract oil by recycling these tyres from the UK, and the UK exporters make a fair amount of money out of the deal.\nSo yes, people engaging in this trade are having a good time earning decent amounts of money, while the labourers working in these plants and the nearby environment suffer beyond repair.\nYou can read\nThursday’s newsletter\nto understand why this needs to stop immediately and what the Indian government is doing about it.\nOpenAI’s new AI model just made everyone a designer overnight\nImagine creating beautiful visuals simply by describing them in plain language — no more complicated tools, no more waiting for graphic designers to send drafts back and forth, and no more complaining.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nImagine creating beautiful visuals simply by describing them in plain language — no more complicated tools, no more waiting for graphic designers to send drafts back and forth, and no more complaining. It’s kind of the ultimate dream, and despite massive advancements in AI, we've always seemed to be just out of reach.\nHowever, OpenAI’s latest image generation model (4o) changes this. It has probably brought us within touching distance of the promised land, if not directly into it. This new model is breathtaking. It seems to get everything right. It can create photorealistic images, it doesn’t mess up the figures, it understands context, and it’s turned everyone into an overnight designer.\nHow do you even make sense of something like this?\nWell, let’s start from the top and ask the most obvious question.\nWhy does it work so well and why can’t other models replicate this?\nWell, there’s an excellent article on “The Verge” explaining this. But if you want a simple explainer, here’s one–\nGPT-4o is an “omnimodal” model, meaning it understands and connects different types of data — like text, images, even audio and video. It also understands prompts better because it was trained to grasp the meaning behind words and images together, rather than strictly following the exact words given. Other models often just follow prompts literally, so you have to provide more details to get the right result. But GPT-4o can guess what you meant even if you don't say everything clearly, making its images match your intention more naturally.\nIt’s also different from diffusion models.\nThese models work by starting with random noise and slowly shaping it into an image, based on the prompt. Every time you want to change something — even a small part — you usually have to regenerate the whole image or use special techniques to edit it. They’re great at making high-quality pictures, but they’re not very interactive or smart about making step-by-step changes.\nThe new 4o image generator is a token-based model that treats images more like language. They “see” the image as a sequence of tokens (like words) and can understand and update specific parts, just like editing a sentence. So if you say “add a tree” or “move the chess piece”, the model can just change that part of the image without touching everything else.\nAlso, since it knows a lot about the world already, it’s really really good at what it does.\nThis will, no doubt, change a few things.\nMarketers and businesses will now have a powerful tool to create and iterate on visuals in real time, without needing advanced design skills. For instance, they can dynamically generate product images with different colours and styles tailored to individual users. They can run extensive A/B tests or adapt entire ad campaigns by describing any updates in plain language. E-commerce platforms can personalise product visuals per customer, while product teams can rapidly prototype UI and UX designs by turning rough ideas into instant visual mockups. Content creators meanwhile will benefit from the ability to adapt or refine their thumbnails on the fly.\nThere’s something in it for everyone. Including OpenAI. This will definitely help them attract a whole bunch of new users. And as more users interact with the platform, OpenAI will gather more data to continuously improve its models. It could be a virtuous cycle and offer the company a massive edge as the AI race gathers momentum.\nHowever, there is one problem that we haven’t discussed yet. What does this mean for designers and graphic artists? If anybody can create compelling visuals with a simple prompt, will their jobs cease to exist?\nWell, people often exaggerate doom when it comes to these things.\nFolks in the 19th century believed mechanised looms would eliminate textile jobs, but the industry expanded, creating new factory-based roles instead. The introduction of ATMs was supposed to make bank tellers redundant, yet their numbers only increased as banks redirected employees toward customer service and sales roles. Personal computers, initially seen as potential job killers, birthed entirely new industries in IT and software development. Even e-commerce, once feared as the end of traditional retail, evolved into an integrated model where traditional brick-and-mortar stores and online platforms work together.\nHumans adapt. That’s what they do. And guess what? Designers will adopt these new advancements and co-opt them into their workflows. The only question is – Who’s smart enough to do it quickly?\nThat we will have to wait and see.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we break down how tyre recycling issues are fueling an environmental crisis in India.\nBut before we begin… We’re on the lookout for a Financial Writer!\nIf you love finance and have a knack for storytelling, this is your chance to join Finshots.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nIndia is one of the world’s largest tyre manufacturing nations, producing around\n20 crore tyres\nannually. And it’s not just domestic demand that keeps the industry running, our tyre exports are thriving too. In fact, we exported tyres worth over\n₹12,000 crores\nin just the first half of FY25. And guess where most of them go? To the United States (US). The US accounts for more than 15% of our tyre exports in value terms. Brazil, Germany, the UAE, France and Italy follow close behind. And when it comes to motorcycle tyres, Colombia in South America is our biggest customer.\nBut here’s the catch. While we export fresh tyres, many Western nations are also sending us something in return: their used-up,\nend-of-life tyres (ELTs)\n.\nNow, these ELTs are essentially waste, shipped to India for recycling. And their sheer volume is staggering, to say the least. To put this in perspective, in 2023 alone, India received\n800,000 tonnes\nof scrapped tyres. And here’s another sobering fact. India actually purchases over\n30%\nof the world’s scrapped tyres. If you’re wondering why, we’ll talk about it a little later in the story.\nHowever, what’s causing ripples in environmental communities and tyre associations in both India and the United Kingdom (UK) is that\nnearly half\nof the tyre scrap to India comes from just one country: the UK. And the sheer amount of pollution it’s causing is alarming.\nHow’s that, you ask?\nYou see, this tyre scrap that lands in India is meant for recycling. And when done right, tyres undergo quite the\ntransformation\n.\nTake the steel, for instance. It makes up about 20% of a tyre. Once extracted, it’s cleaned and sent to smelters, where it finds new life in construction and manufacturing. Then there’s the fibre and nylon, around 15% of the mix, which ends up in carpets, fibreglass and clean-up materials such as absorbent pads and mats used for things like oil spills.\nAnd the rest is mostly rubber. But that doesn’t go to waste either. Some of it turns into tyre-derived fuel (TDF), shredded scrap tyres that supplement traditional fires in controlled industrial settings. Then there’s rubber mulch, a favourite for playgrounds and gardens, and crumb rubber, which gets repurposed for athletic tracks, road surfaces and speed bumps. If processed further, it becomes rubber powder, a high-performance material used in plastics, sealants and even new rubber products.\nSo yeah, nearly every part of a recycled tyre finds a new destination with a useful purpose.\nHowever, the problem starts when these ELTs, especially from the UK, end up in illegal pyrolysis plants across India.\nPyrolysis, in simple terms, is like extreme cooking. Tyres are heated in an oxygen-free environment at around 500°C to extract fuel and other byproducts. But when done improperly, it turns into an environmental disaster. These makeshift plants release a cocktail of toxins:\nheavy metals, benzene, dioxins and furans\n— many of which are highly carcinogenic. You can spot these illegal setups by the thick soot in the air, dying vegetation and polluted waterways nearby.\nThe plant owners, of course, make money. But environmental concerns and public health aren’t exactly on their priority list.\nAnd that begs the question: Why is the UK dumping its tyre waste in India anyway?\nIt’s not like they lack the infrastructure to recycle tyres at home. They do. But sending them abroad is simply cheaper. Investing in shredding machinery is expensive, and Indian pyrolysis plants are willing to pay more for scrap tyres.\nIn the UK, scrap tyres were once compressed into blocks for road foundations, embankments and drainage beds. But the companies making these blocks have either shut down or are struggling because they can’t compete with the prices Indian recyclers offer. Add to this the rising demand for industrial fuel, cheap Chinese-made pyrolysis machines (which otherwise cost tens of millions of dollars) available for as little as\n$30,000\n, and weak regulations, and the trade is thriving.\nAnd here’s the real kicker. Tyres aren’t classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. So, unless the importing country explicitly bans them, there are hardly any restrictions on the global tyre trade.\nThe irony here is that we as a country already generate a massive pile of waste tyres domestically, about 2,75,000 every day, as per a 2021 MoHUA report. Yet, we continue to import millions more, worsening the crisis.\nAlso, the UK’s regulations are laughably lax. Exporters just declare their buyers, and the UK checks with India if these buyers are legitimate. But after that there’s no tracking, no accountability, not even official export figures.\nBecoming a tyre trader in the UK is ridiculously easy, too. All you have to do is fill out a simple\n“U2 environmental exemption”\nform, collect used tyres, and while they’re technically meant for construction, nothing stops traders from shipping them straight to India. Once the tyres leave British shores, the UK washes its hands of them.\nThe Indian government, however, has started cracking down. The Ministry of Environment has banned the import of waste tyres meant for pyrolysis. The Central Pollution Control Board, acting on directives from the National Green Tribunal, has already shut down\n270 illegal pyrolysis plants across 19 states\n. And to add another layer of accountability, a new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework now makes tyre manufacturers responsible for collecting and properly disposing of waste tyres.\nBut despite these efforts, the problem persists. The Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (ATMA) is now pushing for a complete ban on waste tyre imports, pointing out that these imports have surged fivefold since FY21.\nNow, the onus lies on the UK. Just like Australia that completely banned exporting these ELTs to other countries, if the UK follows suit, then the crisis in India can be controlled.\nAnd if this doesn’t happen, the question is, will India put its foot down before the crisis spirals further?\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nIf you’d looked up online dating in 2019, you’d have thought the business was booming. Nearly\n1 in 5\ncouples worldwide had met through a dating app. People loved the simplicity of just quickly swiping right or left to choose or drop a potential match. It’s no wonder that\n250 million\npeople globally had a dating app on their phone back then.\nThen came 2021, and things got even better. The pandemic locked everyone indoors, pushing dating, like everything else, onto the internet. With more people than ever looking for love online, it seemed like the perfect moment for Bumble to go public. And when it did, its market capitalisation hit $13 billion on the first day of trading.\nBut if you had invested in Bumble back then, thinking that online dating was the next big thing, well… let’s just say that investment would be worth peanuts today. That’s because Bumble’s market capitalisation has now plummeted to about $720 million, which means that a $1,000 investment in its stock would be worth\njust $66\ntoday.\nAnd it’s not just Bumble. Match Group, the company behind Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OKCupid, Hinge, Grindr and Plenty of Fish, has also seen its stock take a beating. It’s down\nnearly 80%\nfrom its peak in 2021. And when these companies recently reported weaker-than-expected earnings, their stock prices only dropped further.\nSo, what went wrong with online dating, you ask?\nTo get to the bottom of this, you first need to understand\nhow dating apps make money\n. Contrary to what many believe, online dating isn’t a new phenomenon. It actually dates back to\n1995\nwhen Gary Kremen, a Stanford graduate, had a lightbulb moment. “Why not use the internet to help people find love?”, he thought.\nAt the time, the internet was still a novelty, but dating was expensive. People had to use premium-rate phone lines that charged $3 per minute to connect with potential matches. So Kremen’s idea was simple ― make dating cheaper and more accessible. That’s how Match.com was born.\nFast forward a few decades, and Match Group had become an industry giant. But there was one problem. Dating apps were too efficient. If people found their perfect match quickly, they’d leave. And fewer users meant less money.\nSo, dating apps found a way to keep users hooked. They adopted a freemium model which meant that they were free to join, but the premium features were locked behind a paywall. Want better profiles? Pay up. Unlimited swipes? That’ll cost extra. Even visibility within the app came with a price tag. The goal wasn’t just to help people find love, it was to keep them swiping for as long as possible.\nBut this strategy backfired. Users started experiencing something called ‘dating app fatigue’, where sifting through endless profiles became exhausting. Even when they found a match, there was no guarantee that the other person was looking for the same kind of relationship. The cycle repeated — swipe, match, chat, move on. And over time, people started losing interest. The proof is in the pudding. Global dating app downloads have been falling from 287 million in 2020 to about 237 million in 2023.\nAnd then there’s the trust issue. Many users misrepresent themselves online, leading to disappointment and eroding faith in dating apps. This loss of trust, combined with the paradox of choice, has made people less willing to pay for these services. And when paying users drop, so do revenues.\nYou could look at how pathetic the earnings results have recently been.\nMatch Group’s revenue\nin 2024 was $3.5 billion, up by a measly 3% from the previous year, while its paying users dropped by 5% to 14.9 million. The last quarter was even worse. Revenues declined by 1%, and paying users fell by 4%.\nBumble\nhad a similar story to tell. It generated $1.07 billion in 2024, with revenue growing just 2%. What’s worse is that its losses widened from $552 million in 2023 to $557 million in 2024. And analysts now predict that its revenue could shrink by an average of 1.3% every year for the next three years.\nSo, does this mean online dating is doomed?\nWell, not quite. That’s because the real game for dating apps isn’t about trapping users in an endless cycle of swipes. It’s about figuring out why people are losing interest in paying for the experience in the first place.\nOne big reason is that after the pandemic, more people, especially Gen Z have started ditching dating apps and are opting for real-world connections instead. They’re still potential users, but they’re not the kind to shell out money for a date when they can simply meet new people at clubs, colleges or social events, all for free.\nEven Match Group admitted this shift. In a\nletter to shareholders\nlast year, it noted that younger users were looking for “a lower pressure, more authentic way to find connections”.\nSo Tinder decided to switch things up. Instead of just virtual matches, it started hosting\nin-person meet-ups\n. Think cooking classes, running clubs and other activities where sparks could fly naturally.\nBut Match Group isn’t stopping there. It has mastered the art of dominating the online dating space — snapping up competitors before they become real threats. And this strategy could actually work in its favour. These days, people don’t want to scroll through a generic dating app and feel lost. They want something tailored to their needs. So when niche apps like Muzz (a British dating and marriage app for the Muslim community) start gaining traction, Match knows it needs to pay attention and maybe even make a move.\nThat’s exactly why Match went on to acquire different dating apps over the years. Take Hinge, for example. Those looking for serious relationships are more likely to choose it over Tinder. LGBTQ+ users gravitate towards Grindr. This shift towards niche dating apps isn’t just about preference. It’s proving to be more profitable as well.\nJust look at the numbers. In 2024, Hinge’s direct revenue surged 39% year-over-year to $550 million, driven by a 23% increase in paying users (1.5 million) and a 13% rise in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to $29.94. Grindr’s full-year results weren’t broken down separately, but its first half of 2024 showed a similar growth streak. Revenues jumped 34% to $117 million, while gross operating profit climbed 40% to $68 million, powered by over 14 million active users. Compare that to Tinder’s modest 1% rise in direct revenue and 8% ARPU increase, and you’ll see why Match is doubling down on specialised dating platforms.\nBumble is taking notes too. Last year, it acquired\nGeneva\n, an online platform that helps people form real-world groups and clubs. In 2022, it also bought\nFruitz\n, a dating app tailored to the French community.\nThese moves signal a shift that dating apps are no longer just about swiping.\nBut will these changes be enough to revive the industry?\nOnly time will tell.\nUntil then, love, or at least the business of it, remains a work in progress.\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nYou must be aware that soon after taking office, Trump did what he loves the most: imposing tariffs. He proudly announced a\n25% tariff on all steel and aluminium\nimports from around the world. And he didn’t stop there. He also threatened to slap an extra\n25% tariff on imported copper\n.\nNaturally, this didn’t sit well with America’s major trading partners. And in response, the EU, Canada and China slapped retaliatory tariffs on US imports. But, Trump wasn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet, so he made it clear that the US would slap reciprocal tariffs on any trading partner that would mirror the tariffs on US products.\nBut before we go further, here’s a quick breakdown of what tariffs are and how they work.\nTariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. The companies that bring foreign goods into the country pay a percentage of a product’s value as tax to the government. For example, a 25% tariff on European goods means a product worth $10 has an additional $2.5 charge, now costing $12.5 for US consumers. Now essentially, tariffs are an economic tool meant to protect domestic industries from cheaper imports. Because firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. This makes imported goods expensive and forces customers to opt for cheaper domestically manufactured alternatives.\nBut then there can be a flip side to this too. The imported product may be more functional than the homemade one because manufacturing for it hasn’t taken off very efficiently. And something similar is playing out in the US right now.\nTrump’s new tariffs could drive up consumer prices in the US and around the globe. And that’s exactly what’s giving economists sleepless nights.\nSo then why is he so hell-bent on imposing them, you ask?\nWell, for Trump,\ntariffs\nare a way to boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, raise tax revenue and grow the domestic economy. With tariffs in place, Trump also intends to restore America’s trade balance with its foreign partners. And he’s particularly focused on the EU, where the US had a\n$213 billion trade deficit\nin 2024, something he once called “an atrocity”.\nBut last week, something ironic happened.\nThe US Department of Agriculture requested certain EU nations — Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Lithuania, to export eggs to the US. That’s because bird flu has wiped out millions of hens, causing a massive egg shortage and soaring prices in the US. And that has sort of given the European social media a field day, mocking Trump and terming his request “door-to-door begging”.\nSeems like Trump is having to eat humble pie, no?\nJust a few days ago he was threatening the EU with tariffs and now the US needs European eggs. However, the bigger takeaway here is that we live in a deeply interconnected world where trade between countries and continents is indispensable.\nAnd that’s where tariffs come in. They may seem like a protective shield, but they often come with hidden costs.\nTake Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on copper. It is already causing ripples in the market. The London Metal Exchange (LME), a key commodities exchange for industrial metals, has seen copper prices surge past\n$10,000 per tonne\n. Meanwhile, traders in New York are scrambling to secure copper supplies, pushing up prices on the Commodity Exchange (Comex), the primary futures and options market for metals in the US. The price gap between LME and Comex copper futures has hit a record $1,254 per tonne.\nWhat does this mean?\nSee, Copper is a critical raw material used in technology, construction and renewable energy. A price spike means higher costs for everything from electric vehicles to power grids, making the US domestic industries less competitive. Plus, US manufacturers importing copper will have to bear the extra cost or pass it on to consumers — the very people Trump intends to protect.\nBut that’s not all. While Comex warehouse stocks have risen, LME warehouse stocks are depleting. That suggests traders are already moving metal out of London into the US to avoid future tariffs. So in the short run, Trump’s trade policy is incentivising a rush to stockpile copper before levies hit. And in the long run, this could choke off supply and create an artificial shortage, driving prices even higher.\nAnd let’s not forget history.\nBack in 2018, when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, it did a little bit to boost manufacturing jobs. For instance, tariffs on washing machines created an estimated\n1,800 jobs\nat firms like Samsung, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But this also came at a significant cost to the economy. These tariffs also raised costs for US businesses, disrupted supply chains, and invited retaliation from trading partners like China and the EU, which in turn raised the washing machine prices for consumers. Consumers ended up paying $1.5 billion more every year for washing machines. Or to put it another way, each new job cost the economy over $800,000 on average due to higher prices.\nCopper could meet a similar fate, hurting US manufacturers more than helping them.\nThere are other instances in the past as well where tariffs had unintended consequences. Take the infamous Chicken Tax.\nBack in the early 1960s, American poultry farmers had embraced industrial-scale production, slashing costs and therefore flooding European markets with cheap chicken. This didn’t sit well with European farmers, particularly in France and Germany, who struggled to compete. So, in a bid to protect their domestic poultry industry, they slapped hefty tariffs on American chicken imports.\nFurious at what it saw as an unfair trade barrier, the US imposed a 25% tariff on light trucks, and a few other items exported by the same European nations to the US. The truck tariff, in particular, hit the EU hard, especially\nGermany’s Volkswagen\n, whose\npickup trucks\nwere gaining popularity in the US. And just like that, a dispute over chicken escalated into what became known as the\nChicken War\n.\nAt the time, the goal was to protect American automakers from the surge of small, fuel-efficient European vehicles. But decades later, the Chicken Tax ended up distorting the US auto market in ways no one anticipated. For one, it made foreign trucks significantly more expensive, giving domestic manufacturers like\nFord, General Motors and Stellantis\na near-monopoly on the segment. And while that may sound like a win for the US auto industry, it also removed competitive pressure, which could have led to better innovation and pricing.\nAlso, to combat tariff barriers, some foreign automakers even resorted to bizarre loopholes, like shipping their trucks as passenger vehicles and modifying them upon arrival to the US to avoid the tariff.\nThe end results were higher costs, inefficiencies and a market that evolved not based on consumer demand but on artificial government intervention.\nSo, while tariffs may seem like a powerful economic tool in the short run, history has shown that they often come with unintended costs. And as Trump looks to tighten trade restrictions while simultaneously seeking European eggs, the irony couldn’t be more obvious. Tariffs may look like a shield for domestic industries, but they could also often turn into self-inflicted wounds.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

Luckily, Abid Hassan from Sensibull is here to break it all down for you so you don’t fall for these traps. It’s one of our most fun videos on Finshots yet, and you can watch it by\nclicking here\n.\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nLast week, American pharma giant Eli Lilly\nbecame the first company\nto launch a powerful new type of diabetes and weight-loss drug—called Tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro)—in India. This once-weekly injection belongs to a groundbreaking class of medications known as GLP-1 (and GIP) agonists, drugs that don't just control blood sugar but also help patients lose significant weight without extreme dieting.\nAnd if things play out well, this could revolutionize the Indian healthcare market.\nBut before we get too ahead of ourselves, a quick biology lesson:\nWhen you eat, your food is converted into sugar (glucose) and enters your bloodstream. Normally, your body releases insulin—a hormone that moves this sugar from your blood into your cells, where it’s used for energy. This keeps your blood sugar levels stable.\nBut in type 2 diabetes, either there isn’t enough insulin, or your body doesn’t respond to it properly. As a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This high blood sugar can lead to fatigue, constant hunger, and weight gain.\nThat’s why insulin is crucial—not just for managing blood sugar, but for preventing complications associated with diabetes.\nHowever, here’s the thing—insulin doesn’t work alone. There’s a whole hormonal orchestra playing in the background. We won’t get into all of it here, but two key players are worth knowing: GLP-1 and GIP. Think of them as messengers. They alert your body when blood sugar rises, signal insulin to act, tell your brain when you’re full, and slow down digestion so sugar enters the bloodstream more gradually.\nThey do a lot of stuff in the background.\nAnd this is exactly what the new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs is designed to mimic.\nThe most popular one right now is Semaglutide (promoted under brand names like\nOzempic\nand\nWegovy\n). It replicates the effects of GLP-1—helping the body release more insulin when needed, slowing digestion, and curbing appetite. The second, newer, better version is Tirzepatide (\nMounjaro\n), the Eli Lilly drug that just launched in India. It mimics both GLP-1 and GIP. In addition to boosting insulin and reducing hunger, it also makes insulin work more efficiently—delivering even better blood sugar control.\nSo does this mean Indian doctors will soon start recommending Eli Lilly’s drug to every patient with Obesity and Type-2 Diabetes?\nWell, the answer to that question is a tad bit complicated. According to Reuters, the injection is priced at ₹4,375 for a 5 mg vial and ₹3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial, its lowest doses.\nThat may not seem like a lot of first.\nBut patients on the drug typically see meaningful weight loss only after a few weeks—around 5 kg in 8 weeks and 10 kg in about 16 weeks, as the dose is gradually increased over time.\nAt the starting dose of 2.5 mg, reaching a 5 kg weight loss would require roughly 8 weekly injections, costing around ₹28,000. A 10 kg drop, usually seen over 16 weeks, would bring the total to approximately ₹56,000.\nOuch!!\nBut wait, that’s not all.\nPeople often stay on these drugs for the long term, especially when they’re prescribed for type 2 diabetes management. If the goal is weight loss, doctors typically recommend using these medications continuously—even after hitting a target weight—to maintain the results.\nStopping these medications often leads to weight regain. So many patients remain on them for as long as their doctor deems necessary and they can tolerate it.\nAnd that means over a 12 month term, you could end up spending over ₹2 lakhs on the drug alone.\nThat is very very expensive.\nBut there’s an important catch: the patents protecting these treatments won’t last forever.\nFor instance, Semaglutide (Ozempic) will lose its patent protection in India in 2026 and you can bet that Indian pharma companies are already preparing their own cheaper variants. Their biggest challenge right now is the nature of the treatment itself. Unlike typical medications, GLP-1–based treatments are biologics, meaning they’re large, complex proteins produced in living cells (yeast or bacteria, for example). And these proteins are so structurally intricate and unique that you can’t make an exact copy—only a very close match.\nSo pharma companies have to work around this problem. They have to develop \"biosimilars,\" which closely match the original drug’s safety, effectiveness, and quality, but aren't identical copies.\nAnd not every company has the capability to produce this stuff.\nThe good news however is that some Indian firms have made significant progress. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, for instance,\nrecently launched\nLirafit, a biosimilar of another GLP-1 drug, liraglutide, priced at around ₹100 a day—about 70% cheaper than existing branded options. Meanwhile, Sun Pharmaceuticals\nis taking\na different route. Rather than replicating existing drugs, it's developing a new molecule called GL0034, designed to deliver similar or potentially better results, with a structure distinct enough to be patented on its own.\nAnd if India’s pharmaceutical industry can crack the code, it could dramatically change access to these life-altering drugs.  India has over\n100 million people\nliving with diabetes and an estimated 70 million battling obesity. Among children, the numbers are equally stark. Over 14 million children in India are estimated to be overweight or obese.  This isn’t a future problem. It’s already a national epidemic.\nSo yes, Eli Lilly may have taken the first step. But the real turning point will come when Indian companies bring costs down and scale access for the masses.\nWhen will that happen?\nHopefully soon—maybe 2026.\nUntil then,\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "Hey folks!\nQuick question before we dive into today’s newsletter - Do you want to be a millionaire or retire before you’re 40?🤔 If the answer is yes, there’s one thing you absolutely must avoid and that is falling for shady stock market scams.\nAnd luckily, Abid Hassan from Sensibull is here to break it all down for you so you don’t fall for these traps.\nIt’s one of our most fun videos on Finshots yet, and you can watch it by\nclicking here\n.\nAnd with that out of the way, let’s jump into today’s Sunny Side Up stories, shall we?\nRobots.\nHave you ever seen them move like a human—smoothly, naturally, with a bit of flair?\nNo, right? They are usually stiff, jerky and, well… robot-y.\nBut NVIDIA, Google DeepMind, and Disney Research are working to change that with something called\nNewton\n. And no, it’s not a robot—it’s an open source physics engine, basically the brain behind the moves.\nLet us explain…\nNVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang recently introduced '\nBlue\n', a shiny droid with some Star Wars-style movements. But the real magic wasn’t the robot, it was Newton. This simulation tool helps robots understand the real world—not just by seeing it, but by feeling it. Think of it as giving robots a sense of touch and balance. So whether it’s holding a sandwich or assembling a chair, Newton\nteaches robots\nhow squishy, hard, slippery, or crumbly stuff actually behaves.\nIt even teaches them how to move like us through different types of motion. Perpetual ones like walking (movements that keep going without stopping). Periodic ones like waving (repeating actions in rhythm). And episodic ones like picking something up and putting it back down (actions with clear start and end).\nAnd the best part is all this learning happens in simulation before the robot steps in the real world.\nSo all that means smarter robots, quicker learning, and way less trial-and-error in real life. And this is huge because until now, robots were awkward learners. But Newton gives them a virtual playground to fail, learn, and improve. Just like humans do.\nAnd if robots can now learn to move like us… who knows, maybe one day they’ll learn to dance like us too? 😄\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nMaand\nby Bayaan\nThanks for the lyrical recommendation, Sanjay Jacob!\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nWould you like banking on time?\nImagine a place where every time you help an elderly person with their groceries, walk them to a doctor’s appointment, or simply spend an hour keeping them company, you're not just doing a good deed but also earning hours for your own future. Hours you can cash in when you’re old and need help.\nWell, there actually is a place that’s seeing this happen and it’s none other than Switzerland.\nThe Swiss government has introduced something called a “\nTime Bank\n.” The idea? It’s beautifully simple: Young people volunteer their time to support senior citizens today and in return, they earn \"time credits\" that can be redeemed when they require assistance themselves.\nAnd the initiative has gained traction. In St. Gallen, over 50,000 hours have already been volunteered to support elderly and many countries including Japan, Spain, New Zealand are welcoming such initiatives.\nWow. It’s not money, it’s time. A kind of social currency that works on empathy and reciprocity.\nAnd the idea is a timely one. You see, globally, we’re aging faster than we can prepare for. By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over, and by 2050,\nover 2 billion\npeople will be aged 60 or older. And in India, we’ll have over\n345 million\nsenior citizens by then – almost double from what we have now. And with families becoming smaller, nuclear, and more scattered we can see why the traditional joint family support system isn’t as robust as it used to be.\nNow, India does have a strong culture of caregiving and respect for elders—but that doesn’t always translate into available help. Especially in urban areas where time is scarce and\nloneliness\nis rising. So, could a \"Time Bank\" work in India?\nWell, we do have a few building blocks. India already runs the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and we also have NGOs and state-led schemes offering home-based elder care. But most of it is reactive, not preventive or future-facing. And a system where you earn future care through today’s service could nudge young Indians to engage more consciously with aging.\nIt can reduce the burden on healthcare and elderly homes, it can build stronger intergenerational bonds, and it could shift care from being a charity to a system of mutual respect and investment. And if implemented well, it could even be integrated with existing systems where time credits can be stored securely and accessed nationwide. Or what if students earned community credits for college by helping senior citizens? What if companies gave paid time off to employees who volunteered in elderly care?\nThe options are many and perhaps, like the Swiss, we could start banking some time too.\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\nMarch 22, 1993: Intel announces the Pentium processor\nOn this day, Intel introduced the world to its\nPentium processor\n, a chip that gave personal computers a much-needed speed boost.\nBut before we move further ahead, would you mind checking what processor is running your laptop right now?\nMoving on, for the uninitiated, the Pentium was essentially a microprocessor or, in simple words, the\nbrain of a computer\n. Also known as CPUs (central processing units), these microprocessors are responsible for executing all the instructions—whether it’s opening an app, loading a webpage, or running a game, it controls the flow of data and instructions to carry out a range of tasks.\nBefore the Pentium came along,\nIntel’s 486 processor\nwas running the show. But the Pentium took things to a whole new level.\nFor starters, it was way faster. Unlike the 486, which processed one instruction at a time, the Pentium could juggle multiple instructions simultaneously. Add to that an improved floating-point unit (FPU), and suddenly, complex mathematical calculations, crucial for gaming and graphics, became a breeze.\nBut the Pentium wasn’t just famous for its innovations. It also made headlines for one of the biggest tech blunders. While it was marketed as having faster floating-point calculations, a year after its launch, a math professor, Thomas Nicely, conducting research on prime numbers, discovered that the Pentium occasionally got division calculations wrong. When he ran the same calculation on older computers (not using the Pentium processor), the results were accurate. This confirmed that the issue was specific to the Pentium-run computers.\nPublic disappointment forced Intel to recall and replace the faulty chips, costing Intel a jaw-dropping\n$475 million\n(over a billion dollars today!).\nBut despite the hiccup, the Pentium brand lived on, evolving over multiple generations and playing a key role in shaping modern computing. Then came the 1990s dot-com boom that led to an explosion in PC and server demand, driven by the internet revolution. Intel’s Pentium chips were at the heart of most personal computers.\nAnd the rest is history. We say this because if you had checked your processor by now, chances are it is from Intel!\nReaders Recommend 🗒️\nThis week, our reader Santhoshi Andalam recommends reading\nOrbital by Samantha Harvey\n.\nSanthoshi tells us this book is about 6 astronauts orbiting the Earth – 16 times every 24 hours for 9 months – collecting data, observing the atmosphere and doing all the astronaut things. You might think it's about space endeavours from the title of the book but it isn't. It's simply about the Earth (not in a science-y way) in the eyes and words of 6 people who are completely isolated from everyone and everything.\nInteresting, isn’t it?\nThanks for the rec, Santhoshi.\nThat’s it from us this week.

                    "content": "In this week’s wrap-up, we break down the fallout from IndusInd Bank’s derivatives mismanagement, why Pakistan is struggling to attract investment, whether the CAG’s appointment procedure needs a rethink, why Coca-Cola won’t snack like Pepsi and what happens if LIC enters the health insurance space.\nAnd in this week’s markets edition, we explain why both Adani and the Birla Group are suddenly betting big on cables and wires — and what that could mean for existing players in the industry.\nClick here\nto read the full markets story.\nBut before we begin… We’re on the lookout for a Financial Writer!\nIf you love finance and have a knack for storytelling, this is your chance to join Finshots. We simplify business and finance for 5,00,000+ readers every day, and now, we’re looking for someone who can break down market trends, economic policies and business stories into crisp, engaging reads.\nIf this sounds like you, or you know someone who’d be perfect for the role,\napply here\nor share it with them.\nNow, let’s dive into what we wrote over the week…\nWhen derivatives go wrong\nIn 1995, one rogue trader’s unhedged futures bets brought down the UK’s oldest bank. And recently IndusInd Bank reminded everyone why that story still matters.\nThe bank disclosed a gap in how it accounted for forex derivative losses — ignoring mark-to-market rules and failing to hedge its exposure. Instead of showing losses, it booked them as receivables. The result? ₹19,000 crores in market value wiped out and the RBI now investigating if other banks might be doing something similar.\nNow, IndusInd isn’t accused of fraud like Barings Bank was. But the lapse is worrying. Because when banks mismanage derivatives (powerful but risky financial tools) it doesn’t just hurt profits. It chips away at public trust - and you can know why this is crucial in our\nMonday’s newsletter\n.\nPakistan’s investment woes\nPakistan’s inflation is finally under control. The stock market looks good. And short-term foreign investors are back. So, all’s good, right? Well… not quite.\nThe country’s investment-to-GDP ratio has hit a 64-year low of just 13%. Its wealthy elites are still pouring money into luxury real estate and flashy cars, not long-term industry or infrastructure. Why? Because decades of debt dependence, broken tax systems, and weak industry have made real investment risky and unattractive.\nPakistan now needs $146 billion over the next 5 years just to service its debt. And without productive investments, it’s trapped in a borrow-pay-repeat cycle.\nSo in our\nTuesday story\n, we tell you what’s keeping investments away from Pakistan and if there’s a way out.\nWho watches the watchdog?\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is India’s official public finance watchdog. It’s caught scams like 2G and Coalgate, exposed state-level fund misuse, and held governments to account.\nBut now, the Supreme Court has admitted a plea questioning how the CAG is appointed. The PIL says the CAG shouldn’t be handpicked by the ruling party — it should be chosen by an independent panel.\nWhy? Because recent audits show a worrying trend: some being stalled, others triggering political storms, and some turning into federal face-offs.\nSo if the auditor isn’t truly independent, who’s keeping the government in check? That’s the question at the heart of this petition and we break it down in our\nWednesday newsletter\n.\nWhat keeps Coke out and Pepsi deep in the snacking market?\nPepsiCo sells both drinks and snacks. Coca-Cola? Just drinks. That’s a bit odd, considering snacks make up 80% of Pepsi’s revenue in India and the country’s snack market is booming.\nSo why hasn’t Coca-Cola joined the munch fest, you ask? Because it’s still focused on dominating beverages — especially in rural India, where household penetration is still low. Jumping into snacks would mean splitting resources, building new supply chains, and possibly diluting its brand. Plus, raw materials like potatoes and corn are more volatile than bottling syrup.\nAnd we take a closer look at both these companies in our\nThursday newsletter\n.\nWill LIC change the health insurance market in India?\nIndia’s insurance giant LIC is reportedly eyeing a significant stake in an existing health insurance company. And if it enters the health insurance space, that could change the game.\nWith a massive agent and partner network, LIC could bring health insurance to every corner of India. Think life + health insurance combos, bundled products, and possibly cheaper premiums (thanks to cross-subsidizing from its life insurance profits).\nBut not everyone’s thrilled. Health insurers worry LIC might undercut them, spark a price war, and hurt margins. Plus, if life insurers are allowed back into full-fledged health insurance, it could shake up the market’s regulatory stability.\nSo is there a silver lining to this?

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we climb onto our rooftops to see why a grand 40-gigawatt solar dream has stalled at barely a quarter of that mark.\nBut before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nWhen the government unveiled the\nPM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana\nin February 2024, the promise sounded simple and irresistible: install a solar array on your terrace, receive a fat subsidy, and enjoy up to 300 free electricity units per month.\nBut behind this headline lies a far bigger ambition to install 40 GW (gigawatt) worth of residential rooftop solar capacity across the country. This target wasn’t exactly new. It had already been missed in\n2022\n, and a year later, the tally had crept only to 11 GW even as the country’s overall solar energy output raced past 80 GW. Our rooftops, as it turns out, were still sunbathing without harvesting much of it.\nAnd this lag matters. Because the government’s master plan for 2030 calls for\n280 GW\nof solar power. Out of this, about\n40 GW\nis supposed to come from rooftop solar all around the country by 2027.\nNow, rooftop panels aren’t just to provide homes with free electricity. They also ease stress on an aging power grid, reduce losses during the transmission of power over long distances, and provide a hedge when coal plants fumble during peak summer. This is exactly why rooftop solar deserves more attention.\nThink about it. When your panels reach peak electricity output around noon, any extra power you don’t use flows directly into the local grid through something called net metering. That happens to be the same window when offices crank up their power loads. So every surplus unit pumped into the grid is one less unit the dispatcher has to transmit from a coal plant hundreds of kilometres away. Given that enough homes have solar panels installed, this capacity becomes a big deal.\nSidenote: Contrary to popular belief, the solar panels on your roof will rarely power your home directly. Because most residential systems are grid-tied, any electricity you generate first flows into the grid through a net-metering setup. Your meter then nets off every unit you export from the units you consume, effectively shrinking your bill.\nThis is how local solar generation sidesteps two problems: it saves on long-distance transmission losses and frees up coal capacity for the evening ramp-up, when the sun’s down. A win-win situation.\nYet adequate rooftop solar power generation has been choked by three familiar culprits: patchy subsidies, wary discoms, and upfront costs.\nLet’s talk about subsidies first. The Centre pays up to ₹78,000 of the system cost for smaller arrays (up to 3 KW), but only after you navigate the portal, apply through an empanelled vendor, and after they visit your house to inspect and approve it. This delay can shrink the subsidy’s appeal faster than most people think.\nDistribution companies, meanwhile, are concerned about net-metering. When solar panels generate surplus power, they push it back into the grid, and households receive credits that reduce their bills. Good news for consumers, but bad news for discoms already struggling with debt. (We’ve written about this\nhere\n.)\nUp-front costs are the next roadblock. A normal three-kilowatt array still comes in at roughly ₹1.5 lakh. The Centre promises to refund up to ₹78,000, but for most people, the remaining amount becomes a hurdle. Banks and specialised NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) do offer\ncollateral-free loans\nwith subsidised rates, sometimes covering the entire project cost, yet most households have never heard of them.\nAnd even if the money arrives on time, there’s another problem: installing solar panels requires the services of surveyors, structural engineers, certified electricians, and roofers who can complete the job properly. And this workforce is in\nshort supply\n, especially outside metro cities. Recognising the gap, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has even launched a\n₹2.3 crore\nstart-up challenge about a week ago to fund new firms that solve this exact issue. This is a start, but until every district has a reliable installer and maintenance crew, many prospective buyers will worry about the after-sales service.\nHowever, despite these roadblocks, rooftops still hold an economic trump card: India’s transmission backbone is creaking under record summer demand, projected to surpass\n270 GW\nfor the first time, and the grid is struggling to keep up. Nearly\n20%\nof every unit sent across long distances disappears and never reaches our homes. If we generate that power on our own terrace, this loss is reduced. Scale it across a million homes, and we free up coal capacity for the evening peak.\nSo, can the Surya Ghar yojana rekindle the rooftop boom?\nWell, only if we solve a few problems…\nFirst, distribution companies must establish net-metering as the norm. Second, formal credit needs a marketing push. If households understand they can finance a solar system with ease, adoption will quickly trend upward. Third, skilled labour has to scale. A plumber who transitions into a solar installer after the last housing slowdown is precisely the kind of upskilling that can help them escape poverty; the sooner such talent pools deepen, the faster we can achieve the goal.\nHowever, none of these dismiss utility-scale solar, which remains cheaper per watt thanks to large land banks and bulk procurement. But a centralised grid without rooftop buffers is like a highway without slip roads, where every car funnels through the same chokepoint at rush hour.\nThe bottom line is that if we fix the problems plaguing the  Surya Ghar yojana, rooftops could not only catch up but relieve the grid before the next record-breaking summer surge. The sun, after all, isn’t running out of energy anytime soon. The question is whether we can catch up and reap the rewards.\nUntil then…\nIf this story helped you see the solar picture a little clearer, share it on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\n, or\nX\nand help a friend decode rooftop power in three minutes."

We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nAsian Paints is in hot water again. This time, it’s Aditya Birla Group’s new paint brand, Birla Opus, under Grasim Industries, that’s turned up the heat.\nJust a few days ago,\nGrasim\nknocked on the door of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and accused Asian Paints of abusing its dominant position in the decorative paints market. And the allegations are pretty serious.\nGrasim says that Asian Paints isn’t just comfortably leading the paints market. It’s misusing its power to keep new players out. How?\nWell, Grasim claims that Asian Paints is handing out extra discounts and perks like foreign trips to dealers if they promise to stick only with Asian Paints. In simple terms, these perks aren’t tied to how well a dealer performs. They’re all about staying loyal to Asian Paints. If any dealer dares to stock Birla Opus paints, Grasim says Asian Paints hits back. They cut credit limits, increase sales targets, pull back those fancy perks, reduce customer leads and sometimes even open rival dealerships right next door to squeeze them out.\nIt doesn’t stop there. Grasim also alleges that Asian Paints also restricts suppliers of raw materials from working with them, and even influences landlords, agents and transporters to avoid doing business with Birla Opus. To top it all off, there’s talk of a fake smear campaign to ruin their reputation.\nSo all of these allegations felt serious enough for the CCI to order a formal investigation into the matter.\nBut hold on… doesn’t this feel like an open and shut case already?\nAfter all, just about three years ago, another player, JSW Paints came to the CCI with pretty much the same complaint. Back then, the\nCCI didn’t find any clear misuse\nof power by Asian Paints.\nThe Director General (DG) even pointed out that JSW Paints was working with around 1,591 dealers at the time. And interestingly, 86% of those dealers were also stocking Asian Paints. So if Asian Paints really was bullying them, wouldn’t more dealers have ditched JSW instead? The numbers told an interesting story too. JSW added more net new dealers than Asian Paints’ 1,217 new dealers during 2019–21. And only about 1% of their common dealers actually came forward with any allegations. Plus, sure, some credit limits were cut, but the evidence showed that it was because of genuine payment delays, not some kind of retaliation plot by Asian Paints.\nAnd then there’s another thing that\nAsian Paints highlighted\nthis time around.\nThe decorative paints industry, despite all the noise, isn’t exactly a fortress. Entry barriers are pretty low. Just look at how easily and quickly new players have jumped in and grown over the past few years. Paints don’t just sell through fancy showrooms either. They reach buyers through a huge network of multi-brand dealers. Think electrical shops, hardware stores, sanitary outlets, PVC pipe sellers and even cement shops. And these dealers usually carry multiple paint brands, and they almost always sell regional brands too.\nBut even with so much competition no other brand has scaled up the way Grasim has since launching Birla Opus in March 2024. Asian Paints says that Grasim has been pouring in big bucks to build factories and a massive distribution network. They’ve also hired some of the best people in the industry — even from Asian Paints itself!\nThe proof is in the pudding. In its first year, Birla Opus pulled in revenues of around ₹2,600–₹2,700 crores and Grasim became India’s third-largest decorative paint brand within just six months of going nationwide. In the last quarter of FY25, it grabbed a healthy single-digit market share and built up the country’s second-largest depot network. With 50,000 dealers and as many tinting machines, its reach is ahead of many older players. And thanks to its existing cement business, Grasim can tap into over 2,00,000 dealers across India, giving it an even longer runway to grow.\nSo all this points to one thing. There’s plenty of counter evidence to Grasim’s claims. And this could very well end up like the earlier JSW Paints case — with Asian Paints getting a clean chit.\nWhich brings us back to the question: if the CCI already looked into this once, why has it decided to spend time and energy digging into Asian Paints all over again to figure out if it’s really playing the bully?\nWell, it seems like a lot has changed in the last three years. Or should we say… a lot hasn’t.\nBecause\nAsian Paints started\nway back in 1942 when the British banned paint imports and India ran short on supply. Four friends set up shop in a garage with just five basic colours. And look at them now. Over 80 years later, they’re still the undisputed king of the paints business.\nSure, new brands have popped up but there haven’t been any disruptors. Asian Paints still holds over 50% of the paints and varnish space, while its next biggest rivals, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac, trail far behind at about 14% and 7% respectively. That’s more than twice the gap. Its factories churn out more than half the industry’s total capacity, and its 74,000-plus dealers and 1.6 lakh retail touchpoints nearly double Berger’s reach. Add to that a current market capitalisation of ₹2.6 lakh crores that has compounded at 15% annual growth rate over nearly two decades, and you’ll see why it’s so hard to knock it off its throne.\nSo while the entry barriers are low, the numbers tell that capturing a substantial share in the industry isn’t as easy after all. If it were straightforward, there wouldn’t be such a fight for market share in paints.\nBesides, even though the earlier JSW Paints case went in Asian Paints’ favour, the door was never fully shut. The CCI did hint that stronger proof could swing things differently next time. And this time, there’s more evidence.\nFor context, a market survey Grasim did through a third party shows dealers claiming Asian Paints wasn’t so subtle about keeping them loyal. Some said they were pushed to send back the new Birla Opus tinting machines under pressure. Asian Paints allegedly dangled extra incentives like an extra 1–2% discount, if dealers ditched other brands’ machines. Territory Sales Officers would even slow down credit note approvals (a refund slip for returned or damaged items or purchase adjustments) or drop hints that life would be smoother if they stuck to Asian Paints’ machines.\nAnd here’s something you should know. Tinting machines are an important part of expanding any paints business. Dealers keep basic paints and colours, and these machines mix them to create any shade a customer wants. So it’s like the final link between the paint company and the customer.\nAnd Grasim says that its new tinting machine is better because it’s 40% smaller, can be operated using a tablet, has internet connectivity and can also show dealers useful data to manage stock. But if Asian Paints forces dealers to send these machines back or not use them, it essentially stops new technology from reaching customers. Grasim even gave a list of over 100 dealers who returned their tinting machines because of Asian Paints’ pressure.\nSo yeah, the CCI does seem more convinced this time that there’s enough to dig deeper into whether Asian Paints is throwing its weight around. There’s not just more evidence on the table, there’s also a whole new company stepping up with pretty much the same complaint. But this is just the opening chapter. The real verdict will come once the final findings come in about three months.\nAnd if there’s something new in there, well… that’s a story for another day.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we tell you why India is diverting its record rice surplus for ethanol production and whether it’s a sustainable fix for the long term.\nBut before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nWhat do you do when your godowns are overflowing with more rice than the country can eat, export or give away in ration schemes? If you’re a policymaker, you ferment it to reduce dependency on foreign oil.\nLet us explain.\nThis year, the government is officially diverting over\n5 million metric tonnes\nof rice (about 9% of the world’s annual rice exports) from its stockpiles to make ethanol, the clear, burnable liquid that now makes up nearly 20% of the petrol in your vehicle.\nAnd on paper, it seems like a brilliant move. After all, India harvested a bumper 146 million tonnes of paddy. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is already sitting on 59 million tonnes of rice, which is about four times the buffer stock it actually needs.\nSo instead of letting it rot in silos while taxpayers foot the storage bill, why not turn it into something a bit more… combustible?\nIt might sound odd, but the logic is simple. India imports over 85% of its crude oil. To reduce this reliance, the country has been aggressively pursuing ethanol blending — mixing ethanol into petrol to reduce oil consumption. The goal is 20% blending by 2025, and we’re already at\n18.8%\n.\nAnd the ethanol story has been sweet. Most of it came from sugarcane. You crush the cane, ferment the molasses, distill it, and boom! You get ethanol.\nBut the last couple of years haven’t exactly been great for sugarcane.\nErratic rainfall and droughts\nin states like Maharashtra and Karnataka meant mills couldn’t meet ethanol\nquotas\n.\nSo the government had to look elsewhere.\nAnd when it saw rice just sitting there in surplus, it came up with a plan to divert tonnes of it for ethanol production. Ethanol distilleries began snapping up the stock (especially the “surplus” or broken rice sold by the FCI at subsidised rates).\nThese mills convert it into ethanol and sell it to oil marketing companies. And that’s how the godowns get cleared, mills make money, blending targets stay intact and the oil import bill shrinks.\nBut while this might look like a win-win, it also revives the dilemma around Food vs Fuel.\nYou see, even if this rice isn’t the premium basmati, it’s food. It could be eaten, exported or used in livestock and poultry feed. And diverting food crops for fuel in a country with widespread undernourishment instead of boosting agricultural productivity is a trade-off worth questioning.\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA)\npoints out\nthat in a country where over half the population struggles with malnutrition, and ranks 105th on the\nGlobal Hunger Index\n, diverting land and food grains for ethanol may not be ideal.\nAnd when food becomes fuel, the ripple effects could also run haywire.\nHow, you ask?\nWell, prices shift, demand patterns change and farmers recalibrate what they grow. And that’s how poor households could end up facing higher costs for basic staples.\nTake 2022, for instance. It’s when rice prices surged, the government hit pause on the ethanol plan and even banned broken rice exports. Now that stocks are full again, the diversion has\nresumed\n. But this back-and-forth raises a question: what happens when ethanol starts dictating agriculture?\nThere’s also the issue of efficiency.\nWhile both rice and sugarcane can be used to make ethanol, sugarcane is more straightforward — especially molasses, which is already sugar-rich and easier to ferment.\nRice needs extra steps. You convert starch into sugar using enzymes (a process called saccharification), then ferment, distill and extract ethanol. It’s water and energy intensive, and more expensive.\nSure, when you add up the full emissions from post-harvest transport to wastewater treatment, the net environmental benefits of rice-based ethanol is said to be\nnegligible\n.\nBut the system also sets the stage for weird incentives.\nThink about it. If distilleries are willing to pay more for rice than food buyers, guess who farmers will favour? And once food crops start chasing fuel margins, mandi prices, irrigation policies and even livestock feed markets can get distorted.\nBecause ethanol isn’t a free-market game. The input — FCI rice — is subsidised, and the output — ethanol — is price-guaranteed. So if the numbers don’t add up, someone has to bridge the gap. So it’s a policy puzzle that only works under specific conditions like bumper harvests, low global rice prices and stable domestic inflation.\nAnd then there are the distortions and loopholes.\nThere have been reports of distilleries misclassifying premium grain as “broken” to access FCI rates and subsidies. Or of mills prioritising ethanol over sugar production, causing shortages in the sugar market. Sometimes, blending data itself gets murky. We even broke down a few other policy tangles in an earlier story on\nIndia’s Ethanol Project\n.\nSo then why are we not moving away from rice based ethanol?\nWell, the simple answer is incentives. The government pays up to\n₹58 per litre\nto ethanol producers, depending on the raw material. And in some cases, distilleries make more money from converting rice to ethanol than they would selling it as grain.\nThe government has also floated plans to diversify. Like using maize, sorghum or damaged grains. But rice remains the easier option. It’s available and in abundance.\nAnd that brings up another question – why can’t India shift to second-generation ethanol? (This 2G ethanol is made from crop residue, straw or husk. And it doesn’t mess with food chains and still gives you clean fuel.)\nWell, the simple answer is that this shift is expensive. Second-gen ethanol plants cost around\nten times more\nto set up, compared to sugar or rice based units. The tech is still maturing, and banks are wary of financing projects with unclear returns.\nSo for now, we’re stuck with first-generation solutions like sugarcane, rice or maize.\nGlobally, though, others are already moving.\nFor instance, Brazil uses sugarcane, but also invests heavily in bagasse and waste-based ethanol. The US is shifting from corn to stover, cobs and other residues. China has explored ethanol from cassava and agri-waste, while discouraging the use of edible grains for fuel. All of this didn’t happen overnight but with steady investment in tech, infrastructure and farmer awareness.\nCan India follow suit?\nYes. But maybe we don’t need to leap, just pivot.\nEncourage ethanol from stubble or spoiled grain and build a parallel system instead of leaning on one that’s meant to feed people and livestock.\nOr perhaps, reduce the blending target until we’re truly ready to make this transition efficiently.\nSure, rice is the low-hanging fruit for now. But the longer we keep plucking it, the harder it gets to step back.\nThe good news is that the government has launched schemes like the PM-PRANAM to reward states for using less chemical fertiliser and more organic alternatives which could tie in well with ethanol crop shifts. And it’s\nfunding second-gen\nethanol plants. If these scale well, we could see more sustainable ethanol extraction.\nNevertheless, what does all this mean for you?\nWell, for starters, look at the industry. Sugar companies including Shree Renuka Sugars and Balrampur Chini are betting big on ethanol. Ancillary companies are also in the play, like Praj Industries, which builds and deploys tech for ethanol production. Maize seed players, agri-logistics firms, and even cold storage operators may benefit as ethanol-linked cropping patterns evolve. Top carmakers are\ndoubling down\non flex-fuel vehicles. And some companies are betting on second-gen ethanol.\nSo if you’re an investor, this ethanol ecosystem is something to watch. Just remember that the industry is heavily anchored to government policy and rains.\nThere’s a flip side too. If ethanol production starts driving farming decisions and pushes up food prices, we’ll feel the pinch not just at the fuel pump but at the grocery store too.\nSo yeah, maybe this isn’t just about blending targets or surplus rice. It’s more about balance and trade-offs. Between long-term energy security and short-term inflation. Between smart policy and reactive subsidies.\nFor now, India is fermenting rice. Let’s just hope we don’t stretch the line between necessity and excess while we’re at it.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n.\nNote: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the government pays up to ₹20-24 per litre to ethanol producers. The correct figure is ₹58 per litre, depending on the raw material. The ₹20-24 mentioned earlier is actually the price at which distilleries buy surplus or broken rice. We’ve updated the story to reflect this."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we talk about Amazon’s foray into India’s diagnostics space and whether it can disrupt the industry.\nBut before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nOver the past week, you might’ve noticed something interesting. Shares of India’s diagnostic companies have taken a bit of a tumble. Stocks like Suraksha Diagnostic, Krsnaa Diagnostics, Thyrocare Technologies, Metropolis and Dr. Lal PathLabs slipped by up to 2%, even as the broader market moved in the opposite direction.\nAnd you’ve probably guessed what’s spooked investors this time. But if you haven’t, well,\nAmazon\njust threw its hat into India’s diagnostics ring. It’s now offering at-home test collections, digital reports and bundled health services across six cities covering 450 pincodes. The buzz is that it could shake things up in a big way.\nBut here’s the thing. This isn’t Amazon’s first rodeo in Indian healthcare. It’s already dipped its toes into e-pharmacies and online consultations. Sure, those services are still around, but let’s be honest. They haven’t exactly set the world on fire. It’s more of a work-in-progress than a roaring success.\nSo why is Amazon doubling down and adding new pieces to its healthcare puzzle when it hasn’t really cracked the code yet?\nWell, the simplest answer is that it already had e-pharmacies. But to figure out what to sell, it needed to know why people were buying medicines in the first place. That’s where online consultations came in handy. People could talk to doctors from home, get prescriptions and Amazon could plug into that system — supplying medicines and figuring out which pharmacy partners to work with in each region.\nBut what happens when a doctor suggests a blood test? People typically head to the nearest lab or get it done through a hospital. That’s a piece of the puzzle Amazon didn’t have. So diagnostics felt like a\nnatural extension\n.\nAnd when you zoom out, the diagnostics space in India does look like a ripe opportunity.\nFor context, right now, hospital labs control about\n38%\nof the market. Standalone diagnostic centres take 37% and the big branded chains — the likes of Dr. Lal PathLabs and Thyrocare, hold the remaining 22%. But rewind to five years ago, and the picture looked different. Back then, standalone labs dominated nearly half the market, while big chains held just a measly 15%. Clearly, the winds have shifted.\nSource:\nCRISIL\nWhy?\nBecause starting a small diagnostic lab in India isn’t all that hard. You don’t need fancy equipment or major infrastructure. Regulatory checks are minimal, national accreditations aren’t mandatory and many labs operate without formal registration under the Clinical Establishments Act, which isn’t enforced in most states anyway. In fact, some labs even get by without trained pathologists or microbiologists on site.\nThat makes it easy to enter, but tough to trust.\nAnd when it comes to health, trust matters. Patients are increasingly leaning towards branded labs that offer standardised procedures, reliable results and professional staff. That’s why chains have been gaining ground. They’re able to invest in better equipment, trained professionals and expansion — all while maintaining consistency across locations.\nAdd to that the growing demand, and diagnostics starts to look like a sweet spot. The Indian diagnostics market was worth $18 billion in FY24 and could nearly double to $35 billion by FY30. Operating profit margins are healthy too — around 30% in FY24, even though they’ve been weighed down a bit by the costs of digitisation and customer acquisition.\nNaturally, Amazon’s been paying close attention to all of this.\nPlus, it has the money. It has a trusted brand. It already owns an Indian delivery network and knows how to handle logistics. And now, it doesn’t even need to build everything from scratch. Instead, it’s partnering with Bengaluru-based startup\nOrange Health Labs\n— an accredited diagnostics platform backed by big investors like Accel, Y Combinator and General Catalyst.\nCustomers can choose from over 800 tests, get a sample collected from their home in as little as 60 minutes and receive reports within six hours for most routine tests. It’s fast, digital and designed for convenience, just the way Amazon likes it.\nBut we know what you’re thinking. Why partner with a relatively\nsmall startup\ninstead of a big-name diagnostics chain?\nMaybe it’s because startups are hungrier. They’re often more agile, focused on user experience and eager to build trust from the ground up — exactly the kind of partner Amazon would need if it wants to scale quickly and win customer loyalty.\nBut even with all that firepower, can Amazon actually disrupt diagnostics in India, you ask?\nWell, that’s actually the tricky part.\nAs Amazon India’s Director-Medical, Jayaramakrishnan Balasubramanian, puts it in his media interviews — the goal is to make people trust diagnostics the same way they once learned to trust online shopping.\nBut health isn’t quite like ordering a pair of headphones.\nJust think about it. You usually see a doctor only when something feels off. And for common stuff like a cold or fever, tests aren’t always necessary. When it is serious, you’re more likely to head to a hospital, just in case you need to get admitted. You wouldn’t want to book a test through Amazon and then run to the ER (emergency room) later. It just feels inconvenient.\nWhich means Amazon’s diagnostics model will likely lean heavily on preventive healthcare or getting tests done before something goes wrong.\nBut that’s a tough sell in India.\nPreventive healthcare still has low penetration here. Most people think, “Why spend money when I’m not sick?”\nIt’s the same mindset that plagues insurance. And while Amazon may have excellent customer service, changing this behaviour won’t be easy, especially when the average Indian spends\nless than $15\na year on preventive care, compared to over $2,000 in the US.\nSo the real competition for Amazon’s diagnostics play probably isn’t the diagnostic chains. It’s actually the hospitals. After all, when things get serious, people still trust their local hospital more than an app.\nAnd the only way Amazon could truly go toe to toe with that is if it builds its own hospitals someday.\nWill it take that leap? Well, that’s anyone’s guess for now.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots we take a look at why SEBI fined BSE and what that tells us about how information moves money in markets.\nBut before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nMost of us would think the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is too old to get into trouble. After all, this is the same 150-year-old institution that houses the iconic Phiroze Jeejeebhoy Towers, hosts the bronze bull sculpture at Dalal Street, and became the first stock exchange to get listed in India.\nBut a few days back, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) slapped a\n₹25 lakh penalty on BSE\nfor something pretty damning: giving early access to sensitive company announcements to a select few, and turning a blind eye to broker malpractice.\nAnd if that sounds vaguely familiar, it's because we’ve heard this song before. Back in 2015, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) was caught in a much bigger mess (the infamous\nco-location scam\n) where select high-frequency traders allegedly got access to market data before others. It became one of India’s largest stock market scandals.\nSo when SEBI discovered something similar, even if smaller in scale, they didn’t want history to rhyme. Hence, the order.\nLet’s take it from the top.\nBetween February 2021 and September 2022, SEBI did an inspection of BSE’s systems, particularly its Listing Centre, where companies file all their market-moving announcements. Think quarterly results, bonus issues, board meeting resolutions, dividend declarations — the kind of stuff that can send stock prices moving in seconds. The Listing Centre or so called Corporate Announcement Filing System (CAFS) is meant to be the bridge between companies and the public, a neutral upload zone where everything hits the market at once for all to see.\nBut here’s the problem: before it reached everyone, it may have reached some.\nSEBI allegedly found that BSE’s Listing Compliance Monitoring (LCM) and a set of clients potentially had access to this data early. These clients were paid subscribers who accessed corporate announcements through leased lines and APIs (Application Programming Interface) — a premium data feed that may have delivered information seconds before it was made public on the BSE’s website.\nAnd in a world of high-frequency trading, a few seconds aren’t trivial. Even two seconds of lead time can mean placing a trade before the market absorbs the news. That’s not insight but an edge. And it’s unfair. The order further clarified that corporate announcements yet to be published officially by the exchange fall under \"unpublished price-sensitive information\" (UPSI), inherently posing a risk of misuse even if direct evidence of exploitation was not conclusively established.\nWorse still, SEBI noted that BSE didn’t use a uniform push mechanism like an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed (a digital broadcast pipe that sends out the same information to everyone simultaneously the moment it’s published). Instead, BSE relied on a pull model, where different users retrieved the data from the server manually or via APIs. Which means people with faster access, better software, or inside connections could simply pull it sooner.\nAnd this is exactly what creates a tiered information ecosystem where some pay for speed, and others lag behind. And when the system is designed this way by the exchange itself, the implications are serious. Because the exchange is meant to be neutral, it’s not supposed to be a gatekeeper or toll booth for public information.\nNow, BSE did admit that this gap existed. But it claimed it had no material impact on investors. SEBI, however, didn’t buy it. They said the lapses reflected “a lethargic approach,” that corrections only came after the inspection, and that such failures, if allowed to continue, “will be a serious setback to the image and the prestige of the BSE and SEBI both.”\nAnd the disclosures weren’t the only problem.\nSEBI also flagged another troubling trend about how BSE handled client code modifications by brokers. To simplify: every trade on the stock exchange is linked to a unique client code. If a broker enters the wrong one — say, mistypes a client ID — there’s a provision to fix that later. But it’s only meant for genuine errors. But what SEBI found was routine misuse. Brokers were shifting trades between unrelated institutional clients or error accounts without proper oversight. And BSE wasn’t doing enough to review or flag these frequent modifications. That kind of blind spot opens the door to all sorts of bad behaviour from tax evasion, profit dressing, or manipulating trade records.\nThis comes at a time when Indian capital markets are trying to build more trust — both for global investors who are pouring money into India and for retail investors who now form\nover 60%\nof ownership in the free float market. When stock exchanges, which are supposed to be neutral infrastructure providers, start giving even a sliver of unfair access, it threatens to dent that trust.\nAnd India only has two major full-service stock exchanges — NSE and BSE. NSE already dominates with over\n90% share\nin the equities market. That makes BSE’s role as a\ncounterbalance\neven more important. BSE’s website, on an average, experiences about 8.95 million page views and 0.26 million users daily. If even that isn’t run flawlessly, it doesn’t just damage credibility; it limits choice.\nNow, you might be thinking, okay, fine, this seems like a back-end manipulation. What does this have to do with me?\nWell, here’s the thing. In capital markets, information is everything. Big money is made not just by what you know, but when you know it. And if select players get early access to key information it can tilt the odds heavily in their favour. That’s how hedge funds run event-driven strategies. That’s how prop desks jump ahead of earnings. And that’s how retail investors, more often than not, get left behind.\nSo what do you do about it?\nWell, you fight asymmetric information with long-term conviction. That means buying companies you understand, that compound earnings year after year. Not ones you have to out-game someone else to profit from.\nLooking beyond the headlines helps too. Like block and bulk deals, where large investors quietly make their moves. Like changes in promoter pledges or auditor resignations, often buried in footnotes. Or insider buying patterns. Or yes, even inconsistencies in corporate filings that might hint at deeper shifts before the market fully reacts. That’s all public information and it often gives you a hint of how things might be moving at the company level.\nBecause if you can’t compete on speed, you have to win on depth, and that's easier said than done.\nAnd that’s why SEBI’s action against BSE matters.\nSure, ₹25 lakh isn’t a huge penalty for a company that made ₹1,322 crores in net profit last year. But this isn’t about the fine. It’s about the message. That in the race to monetise data, exchanges can’t forget their core duty of levelling the playing field.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "title": "Finshots College Weekly - Siri & Sanction",
                    "content": "In this week’s newsletter, we talk about how Siri might be holding Apple back in the AI race, why the Strait of Hormuz won’t shut down, brand logos and more.\nIf you'd like to receive our 3-min daily newsletter that breaks down the world of business & finance in plain English -\nclick here\n.\nQuote of the day 📜:\nYou can’t always visualize the reward, but you can believe in the sacrifice if the vision is strong enough.” – Don Connelly\nShould Apple kill Siri?\nExactly a year ago, Apple promised the world a ChatGPT-like Siri. But when the big reveal finally happened a few days ago, that futuristic Siri was nowhere to be seen. Instead, Apple announced a\ndeeper integration with ChatGPT\nitself, the very tool it partnered with last year.\nSo… what happened to the smarter, sassier Siri?\nWell, it looks like Apple may have lost it along the way. Because when people say, “Hey Siri, can you send a message please?” there’s often nothing but radio silence. And when it does respond, it’s rarely on the same page. For instance, Wall Street Journal journalist\nJoanna Stern\neven asked, “Hey Siri, are you still alive in there?” To which Siri blandly replied, “I’m Siri, your virtual assistant.”\nThat sure answers everything right? But hey, Siri was groundbreaking when it launched in 2011. So, what went wrong?\nTo understand that let’s go back to\nwhere it all began\n.\nSee, before Siri became Apple’s iconic voice assistant, it had a very different origin story. Back in 2003, a nonprofit research group called SRI International began working on a US government-backed AI project known as CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). Their goal was to build an assistant smart enough to learn from and adapt to its user.\nThat research eventually gave rise to Siri. In 2007, a few engineers branched out to launch Siri Inc., a startup focused on bringing this technology to consumers. By 2010, they released the Siri app for the iPhone. It let people do things like book cabs or make dinner reservations just by speaking to their phone. It was way ahead of its time.\nBut Siri Inc.’s independence didn’t last long. Within a couple of months, Apple stepped in and acquired it. The original team had plans to take Siri to Android and BlackBerry too, but Apple did something even smarter. It removed the app from the store and started building Siri directly into iOS.\nThen in 2011, Siri made its official debut on the iPhone 4S. You could talk to your phone like you were talking to a person. Siri answered questions, sent texts, set reminders and even cracked a joke or two. And that blew people away.\nBut now Siri seems to have failed to catch up.\nAnd the reason might be that Apple has always been more of a hardware giant than a software powerhouse. Sure, it built its own operating systems, but that was mostly by standing on the shoulders of\nMac OS X\n, a stable, well-built foundation that let Apple offer a seamless experience to users and developers alike. But as the tech world shifted towards AI and rapid-fire software updates, Apple found itself facing three big hurdles.\nFirst, Apple is a perfectionist. Really. It only ships products that meet its famously\nhigh standards\n. Clean design, minimalist interfaces, intuitive functionality — that’s the Apple way.\nBut in a world where new AI tools launch every other week, perfection can be a problem. The pace is too fast. The competition’s too bold. And waiting around for the perfect product could just mean getting left behind.\nSo when Apple started teasing the iPhone 16 with snazzy new features — like a smarter Siri that could use personal data (understanding things like “When is my next meeting with investors?”) and app context (for example, “Make this photo pop, and add it to the Goa 2025 vacation album”), or Apple Intelligence tools that summarise text, prioritise notifications, and edit photos — expectations ran high. But behind the scenes,\nengineers testing\nthese beta features found something troubling… they didn’t always work.\nSome even had to be rolled back after going rogue. Remember that summarisation feature that was supposed to help by condensing messages, news and notifications? It misfired pretty badly. There was this\none case\nwhere someone got a text from their mum saying, “That hike almost killed me!” The AI’s summary? “Attempted suicide but recovered and hiked in Redlands and Palm Springs.” That doesn’t sound great at all.\nThen there’s the fact that Apple hasn’t exactly been best friends with AI. You could say it’s been more cautious than curious. For years Apple largely refused to even use the word “AI”, until it did in a stubborn way by calling it “Apple Intelligence”. That might come from the fact that folks like Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, have reportedly been reluctant to throw big money at AI. For context, Apple has spent just $11 billion on capital expenditure over the past year. That’s barely about 15% of what its peers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta spent on average. Because from Apple’s point of view, it’s a high-risk game. Unlike hardware or traditional software updates where the outcome is more predictable, AI feels like a gamble. You pour in time and resources without knowing exactly what you’ll get in return.\nFederighi didn’t exactly see AI as a “must-have” for personal computers or smartphones either. He didn’t want to pull resources away from what Apple’s already great at — rolling out those polished, annual upgrades for iPhones, Macs and iPads. In AI, it’s common to dive in without a clear picture of the final product, figuring things out as you go. But that’s not Apple’s style. Apple tends to work with a destination in mind, building with purpose rather than experimenting aimlessly.\nThat mindset, along with its deep-rooted focus on user privacy, is probably what’s kept Apple from jumping in headfirst like Microsoft, Meta or Amazon, all of whom have either built or acquired large language models (LLMs) or AI chatbots.\nAnd that brings us to the biggest conflict — Apple’s famous commitment to privacy. Yup, it’s true that Apple’s privacy controls are far stricter than most of its competitors. But that strength also becomes a weakness when it comes to AI. Limiting the amount of user data it collects means Apple doesn’t have the same massive datasets that others rely on to train and improve their AI.\nEven with its new ChatGPT integration, Apple insists on user consent before sending off queries. And OpenAI doesn’t get to keep the data either. That’s great for protecting privacy, but it also makes it harder for Apple to catch up.\nWhich leaves us wondering — should Apple just kill Siri?\nLet’s face it, Siri’s reputation has taken quite a beating over the years. It’s been clunky, slow, and frustrating for users. And now, with Apple Intelligence in the mix, things have only gotten messier. Some\nbasic features\nthat used to work just fine, like sending a simple text, are suddenly glitchy. So maybe it’s time to stop clinging to the nostalgia of Siri and admit that the old assistant might be more of a burden than a badge of honour.\nMaybe what Apple really needs is a clean break and a total rebrand.\nAfter all, it\nwouldn’t be the first\nto do it. Google swapped out Assistant for Gemini. Microsoft shelved Cortana and bet big on Copilot. So why not Apple?\nOf course, Apple being Apple might want to hold on, stick to its identity, do things its own way and be the perfectionist.\nBut if that’s the path it wants to take, it needs to move faster. Because in the world of AI, the clock doesn’t wait. And the competition sure won’t either.\nWhy Iran can’t shut down the Strait of Hormuz\nWe wouldn’t blame you if you thought that the global oil market was on the verge of collapse.\nAfter all, Iran’s parliament just voted to\nshut down\nthe Strait of Hormuz — the narrow stretch of water through which nearly 20% of the world’s oil and a third of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows every single day.\nAnd with tensions in the Middle East flaring up again, this could be a critical moment that upends a global energy artery and eventually hits your wallet too.\nBut here’s the thing. While the headlines scream closure, the reality is a bit more complicated. Actually, a lot more complicated.\nAnd to understand how it could impact you, let’s take it from the top.\nThe Strait of Hormuz is a 39-kilometre-wide waterway between Iran and Oman.\nSource:\nAl Jazeera\nAt its tightest point, the shipping lanes are just three kilometres wide in each direction, separated by a buffer zone. Every day, over 21 million barrels of crude oil and refined products pass through it. And about\n84%\nof that oil and LNG heads to Asia, with China, India, Japan and South Korea being the top buyers.\nSo yeah, if the Strait ever truly shut down, the global economy would feel it almost immediately.\nBut you see, while the Iranian legislators may have said to block this channel, the final decision vests with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. And unless that goes ahead, there can’t be a closure.\nAnd here’s where things get a little ironic because what’s often left out of the narrative is that Iran itself relies on this route more than most.\nDespite years of sanctions, Iran still manages to export about\n1.7 million barrels of oil\nper day (bpd). And nearly\n90%\nof that heads to China, its most important customer and arguably its last major economic lifeline.\nAll of this oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz.\nNow, sure, Iran has built a new terminal at Jask, just outside the Strait. But it’s not yet equipped to handle full volumes. In 2024, for instance, it processed less than\n70,000 bpd\n— just a fraction of Iran’s total exports. Which means, if Iran were to actually close the Strait, it wouldn’t just be blocking Saudi or Emirati oil. It would also be choking off its own revenue stream.\nAnd that’s not all. A large chunk of Iran’s own imports — everything from food to fuel additives, also sails through Hormuz.\nThen there’s the question of who else gets affected. The US, for one, doesn’t buy much Iranian oil or gas. Neither does Europe — at least not officially. While the US does import about half a million bpd from Persian Gulf countries via Hormuz, that makes up just 7% of its total petroleum liquids consumption, thanks to domestic shale production and steady imports from Canada.\nSource:\nEIA\nBut let’s say for argument’s sake that the worst does happen. Hormuz is closed.\nEven then, history tells us that the panic may be short-lived.\nBack in 2003, just before the Iraq War, oil prices surged by over 40%, only to tumble, once things escalated. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, oil touched $130 per barrel. Within three months, it was back down below $100. Why? Because demand adjusts, inventories get tapped and importantly, backup options kick in.\nFor instance, Saudi Arabia can redirect about 5 million bpd through its East-West pipeline to the Red Sea. The UAE has a 1.8 million bpd pipeline that bypasses Hormuz entirely via the port of Fujairah. China holds over 1 billion barrels in strategic reserves. And in 2024, the US brought its crude imports from the Gulf down to the\nlowest level\nin nearly four decades.\nThe only way to shut down the Strait is if Iran lays\nmarine mines\n. But there are a bunch of Western mine sweeping ships nearby, ready to deal with that if it happens. And even that kind of move will invite retaliatory action.\nNow that might make you wonder — fine, maybe Iran won’t go all in. But what if it disrupts traffic just enough to scare the markets?\nWell, that’s already playing out.\nShipping rates\nfor Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) have doubled in recent days, and war risk premiums for oil tankers operating in the Persian Gulf have shot up. These premiums are extra charges shipowners demand when entering dangerous zones. Basically, higher pay for higher risk. And with nearly 1,000 vessels experiencing\nGPS jamming\nevery day in and around Hormuz, the danger feels real enough.\nAnd this is the part that most headlines miss. The real threat isn’t a hard closure of the Strait. It’s the soft disruption that this kind of shadow warfare brings. It raises friction, uncertainty and costs.\nAs someone told me the other day,\n‘The travesty of our times is – conflict isn’t failure, but a business model.’\nThat cost trickles silently through the global economy. It hits refiners who now pay more to secure their cargo. It hits logistics firms whose expenses rise across shipping lanes. And it hits governments, which either dip into reserves or shell out more to subsidise fuel.\nTake India for example. Refiners like Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL source a large chuck of their crude from the Gulf nations, often under long-term contracts routed via the Strait of Hormuz. While we’ve diversified with imports from other nations, nearly two-thirds of our crude and half of LNG imports still pass through that narrow waterway.\nYou may not see petrol or diesel prices spike immediately, thanks to state administered pricing. But behind the scenes, higher freight and insurance costs slowly bleed into the economy.\nPaint manufacturers like Asian Paints and Berger feel it in input costs, as oil derived solvents get pricier. Pharma companies like Dr Reddy’s, Lupin and even Sun Pharma — which has a huge presence in the Middle East with its majority stake in Taro Pharmaceuticals — could take a hit. Airlines, where fuel makes up 30–40% of costs, see their margins wobble. Cement and steel companies, reliant on diesel for last-mile freight, get squeezed.\nFertiliser firms\nfeel the pinch. Even FMCG giants like HUL and Dabur take a hit as distribution becomes costlier.\nIt all shows up, quietly, in earnings calls. In falling EPS. In trimmed forecasts.\nAnd if you’re watching from the sidelines, the impact doesn’t always show up where you’d expect. Oil prices may take time to react. The bigger signals often surface first — in rising insurance premiums, surging tanker rates, port congestion and delayed delivery cycles.\nIn India, this sensitivity often plays out in the stock market. Logistics stocks tend to price in disruption risk faster than oil linked ones.\nBecause at the end of the day, markets don’t just react to headlines. They react to how events ripple through trade flows.\nIn a world this tightly wound, a 39-kilometre stretch of water can quietly move prices on Dalal Street. And that’s why the Strait of Hormuz matters. Not just for the oil it ferries, but for what it symbolises: a fragile hinge upon which global trade, inflation and portfolios turn.\nAnd perhaps that’s why, despite the threats, it never really stops running.\nInfographic: Hidden Meanings Behind Brand Logos"

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, let’s take a look at the Indian Government’s dividend portfolio and understand whether such a portfolio would help you & me, as retail investors.\nBut before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nEarlier this year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) handed the government a record surplus payout of ₹2.69 lakh crore. That’s\n27%\nhigher than last year’s transfer. (We even wrote about it in\nthis edition\nof Finshots). A little while later, several public sector undertakings (PSUs) began announcing significant dividends to their shareholders.\nThese two events seem quite unrelated. So why are we talking about this now?\nWell, these two events reveal something about how policymakers are thinking about money. More specifically, about how to raise money for the public exchequer without increasing debt or taxes (yes, you read that right).\nAnd there’s one more clue that ties it all together. In the Union Budget 2025, the government quietly doubled the threshold for tax deducted at source (TDS) on dividend income from\n₹5,000 to ₹10,000\n. That means retail investors can now receive a larger chunk of dividend income without the taxman automatically deducting a portion upfront. It ain't much, but it helps out people doing honest work.\nBut to understand the government’s thinking, it helps to look at what makes dividends so appealing in the first place.\nFirst, dividends are immediate, visible, and bankable. Unlike capital gains, which occur only when you sell the shares, dividend income hits the bank without doing so. In a year when tax collections can wobble and disinvestment targets are missed, predictable cash from public enterprises is a policymaker’s comfort blanket.\nSecond, each extra rupee arriving via dividends is one less rupee the Centre must borrow. Lower borrowing shrinks the supply of fresh government securities, which can trim bond yields, reduce interest payments, and, in turn, free up room for spending.\nThird, many mature public firms have large cash piles earning modest returns. Forcing those rupees back to the shareholder either funds the exchequer directly or signals that idling capital will no longer be tolerated. From a governance standpoint, that is progress.\nThis brings us to the question: if the government is relying more on dividends to shore up its finances, should you and I, as retail investors, be doing the same?\nAfter all, dividends feel good. There’s a certain comfort in seeing actual rupees land in your bank account every quarter, especially when markets are volatile or just moving sideways. It’s money you can spend, reinvest, or simply use as reassurance that your investments are doing something productive. And with PSUs under pressure to increase their payouts, the yields on some of these stocks look more attractive on paper.\nBut here’s where it gets interesting. The textbook definition of a dividend is simple. When a company earns profits, it can either reinvest those profits back into the business or return a portion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Let’s say a company pays ₹10 as a dividend per share; the share price, in theory, should drop by ₹10 on the record date.\nThat’s because the company is handing over ₹10 of its cash to shareholders. This cash leaves the company’s books and, all else being equal, reduces the company’s net worth by the same amount. Since the value of a stock is ultimately tied to what the company owns and earns, the market adjusts the share price downward to reflect that outflow.\nBut if the business is healthy, generating good cash flows, and continues to grow, the market often shrugs off this short-term dip. In fact, the share price can recover fairly quickly, especially if the payout signals confidence in future earnings.\nThis is one reason why investors are drawn to dividend-paying companies in the first place. There’s a perception of stability, where the company is saying, “Hey, I’m rewarding you for holding this stock, and I’m confident that the company can grow even without this money.”\nSectors such as tobacco, utilities, or large-cap IT firms tend to be\nmature businesses\nwith fewer opportunities for aggressive reinvestment. They generate steady cash and don’t need to plough it all back into expansion. So, instead of letting the cash pile up, they share the spoils with shareholders. And for investors looking for predictable income, that’s a pretty compelling proposition.\nEven some of the world’s most respected investors, such as Warren Buffett, own large positions in dividend-paying giants. Coca-Cola, for instance, has been in Buffett’s portfolio for over three decades, consistently delivering dividends that have grown over time.\nBut here’s the thing: Buffett doesn’t chase dividends. What he actually cares about is\ncapital allocation\n. He wants companies to deploy capital in the most efficient way possible. The dividend itself is not the prize; it’s a byproduct of a business that’s run well.\nAnd this is exactly where we need to draw the line. Not all dividends are created equal.\nSometimes, a high dividend yield isn’t a sign of strength. For instance, when a company’s earnings are stagnating or its stock price is falling, the dividend yield can look artificially high. Imagine a firm whose stock price has been cut in half, but the dividend hasn’t changed. Suddenly, the yield looks sky-high. But dig a little deeper and you might find the business is in decline, and the dividend isn’t sustainable. These are known as\nvalue traps\n. These are companies that lure you in with big payouts but offer little in terms of long-term growth.\nThen, there’s the matter of taxes.\nFor retail investors in India, dividend income is added to your total income and taxed at your applicable slab rate. So, if you fall into the 30% bracket, a 5% dividend yield effectively becomes 3.5% after tax. And that’s before inflation takes another bite. Compare that to a company that reinvests profits at a decent growth rate or IRR (internal rate of return), and over time, that compounding often beats the upfront gratification of a taxed dividend.\nThis is why many advisors suggest viewing dividends as just one piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. A good dividend stock should not only pay a decent yield but also have strong fundamentals: consistent free cash flow, healthy earnings, and a reasonable payout ratio. Ideally, the company should continue to reinvest a portion of its profits to fund future growth. If a firm is paying out 90% or more of its profits every year, that’s usually a red flag. It means there’s very little left to fuel expansion, pay off debt, or handle tough times.\nThat said, dividend investing isn’t a bad idea. It just needs to be done thoughtfully.\nIf you’re someone who relies on investment income to cover monthly expenses, such as a retiree, a well-constructed dividend portfolio can be a predictable source of cash flow. And since your overall income may be lower in retirement, the tax impact might be softer, too. In that case, targeting stable, high-quality companies with a track record of sustainable payouts makes sense.\nBut if you’re still in the ‘wealth accumulation’ phase, then chasing high dividend yields might slow you down. You’d likely be better off focusing on total returns: a combination of capital gains and income, rather than just what lands in your account each quarter.\nSo, where does this leave us?\nDividends are not magic. They’re not inherently good or bad. They’re just one way a company can share its profits. And just like the government is using dividends as a tool to improve its cash flow without raising taxes, investors can use dividends as a way to build short-term income, but remember that it does affect the long-term performance of your portfolio.\nSure, it’s tempting to buy a stock just because it offers a 6% or 7% yield. But, after every dividend announcement, ask whether the company can still grow, whether its balance sheet stays strong after the dividend is paid out, and whether your after-tax yield beats what you could earn by letting those profits compound inside the firm. Only when the answer to all three is ‘Yes’ does a dividend become a gift rather than a costly comfort.\nUntil then…\nKnow someone who’s a fan of dividend stocks?

Without these options, growing or even staying afloat becomes tough.\nAnd that’s exactly the kind of financial squeeze a\nglobal coalition of environmental groups\nincluding Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack and Oil Change International, wants for fossil fuel companies.\nTheir goal is simple.\nMake it harder for oil, gas and coal firms to raise capital so that they’re forced to pivot into cleaner, renewable businesses instead of expanding their fossil fuel operations.\nSounds logical, right?\nBut there’s one problem. Banks, the very foundation of this funding system, aren’t exactly playing along.\nBack in April 2021, many global banks proudly signed the\nNet-Zero Banking Alliance\n(NZBA), a net-zero initiative. The pledge was simple: align their financing activities with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.\nBut fast forward to now, and the numbers tell a very different story.\nBetween 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 biggest banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and even SBI (State Bank of India), poured a whopping $3.3 trillion into companies still knee deep in the fossil fuel business. And in the past year alone, that figure has jumped by over 20% to $869 billion.\nSo while banks make bold promises on their climate commitments, their money is clearly walking in the opposite direction.\nAnd sure, some of these banks are also funding renewable energy. But when they keep backing fossil fuels at this scale, it undercuts their clean energy investments and worsens the climate crisis. It’s like trying to empty a bathtub with one hand while the tap’s still running full blast.\nSo why are banks still doing this?\nWell, one reason is something called transition finance. Basically, banks argue that cutting fossil fuel companies off entirely doesn’t help anyone. Instead, they say it’s better to fund these companies so they can reduce emissions by investing in renewables, shutting down old plants or installing carbon capture technology.\nThat sounds fair in theory and in some cases, it works too.\nTake the example of\nStarwood Energy\n(now Lotus Infrastructure). In 2022, it closed two coal plants — Logan and Chambers, a full 30 months earlier than planned. It worked out a deal with its power buyer Atlantic City Electric to end the contract early and raise $200 million in loans at lower rates to clean up the sites and replace them with renewable energy. And instead of sticking with coal, Starwood decided to turn both sites into large clean energy battery hubs. The shutdown helped cut nearly 4 million tons of CO₂ emissions. And now, those old coal sites are being transformed to store clean energy for the grid.\nThat’s how transition financing should work.\nBut with banks, the reality is that many of them use this idea as an excuse to keep funding fossil fuel companies, even if those companies have no serious plan to transition.\nOn top of that, there’s the bigger issue — greenwashing.\nMany banks make it sound like they’re cutting ties with fossil fuels. But when you look closer at the fine print in their policies, you’ll find some pretty big loopholes.\nFor instance, some banks claim that they no longer fund fossil fuel projects like new oil pipelines or coal mines. That’s great. But they still offer general-purpose loans to the companies behind these projects. And guess what? Those loans can still be used to fund fossil fuel expansion.\nOnly about half the world’s banks with oil and gas policies take the extra step of also cutting off funding at the company level. And when it comes to coal, only 16 out of 1,800 banks say they won’t fund companies that are expanding in coal, which still isn’t enough.\nSome banks use both project level and company level exclusions. But even then, fossil fuel companies often find ways around these policies. This simply means that while banks can say no to a risky project, they could still invest in the company behind it. It’s like saying, “We won’t support your bad idea... but we’ll still give you cash to do other stuff.”\nTake TotalEnergies, for example. Several banks refused to back its controversial LNG project in Papua New Guinea. But most of them still invest in the company itself. The proof is in the pudding. According to the latest Fossil Fuel Finance Report, 70% of the money that went into expanding fossil fuel projects in 2024, actually came from banks that claimed to have some sort of exclusion policy.\nSo yeah, even though many banks say that they’re limiting fossil fuel financing, their policies are often inconsistent, full of loopholes and easily bypassed.\nAnd finally, there’s the issue of\nstranded asset risk\nor the idea that fossil fuel assets could suddenly lose value because of new climate laws or a shift to clean energy.\nSee, when the bond market lends to fossil fuel companies, it charges higher rates because it factors in this risk. That makes borrowing more expensive for these companies. But banks don’t do that. They often underestimate the risk and continue lending at cheaper rates. And that gives fossil fuel companies easy access to money, especially when they know there are banks willing to lend without demanding real transition plans.\nSo, what’s the solution, you ask?\nWell, the folks behind the Fossil Fuel Finance Report offer a simple starting point. They say that banks need to set clear, strict limits on the emissions they’re financing — targets that actually line up with the 1.5°C climate goal. And that means setting real deadlines for cutting emissions across every part of the fossil fuel chain from production to transport to final use.\nThey also suggest that banks must immediately stop funding fossil fuel expansion. That means no loans, investments or support for companies building new coal, oil or gas projects. This should apply not just to specific projects, but also to general funding or helping those companies raise money in the markets. It doesn’t matter how big or small the expansion is. If a company is planning to grow its fossil fuel business, banks shouldn’t be involved.\nSounds simple enough. But there’s a catch. And it’s called the\nsubstitution effect\n.\nThis is simply when one bank pulls out of a fossil fuel deal, another often steps in to take its place. Especially in large, syndicated loans where multiple banks pool money to fund a large deal. So unless everyone acts together and stops funding fossil fuel expansion, the money will always find a way.\nAnd things are only getting messier.\nThe US plans to officially\nexit the Paris Agreement\nin 2026. That means American banks won’t be bound by global climate goals. In fact, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have already\nwalked out of the NZBA\n. That has nudged four of Canada’s top lenders to follow suit, and now European banks are starting to consider leaving too.\nIt’s turning into a domino effect. Big banks from big economies are quietly stepping back from their climate commitments, just when the world needs them most.\nBut the dilemma is that achieving net zero emissions globally by 2050 would mean annual investment in oil, gas and coal must fall by more than half by 2030. And if the big economies, which have also been the\nworld’s biggest polluters\n, don’t take the lead, then what’s the point? We could write reports or set targets… but without real leadership, it’s all just words on paper.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "title": "Understanding the HDB Financial Services IPO",
                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we break down HDB Financial Services’ long-awaited initial public offer (IPO), which opens its offer on 25\nth\nJune (Wednesday).\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nIn 2007, just as India’s middle class was expanding and credit demand was booming, HDFC Bank quietly spun up a new engine — one that wouldn’t be weighed down by the regulatory limits of traditional banking. It was a non-banking financial company (NBFC) called HDB Financial Services.\nAt the time, NBFCs were the wild west of Indian lending. They could cater to borrowers the banks ignored or folks with thin credit files, small business owners and those seeking quick cash for weddings or emergencies. HDFC Bank wanted in, but without muddying its clean, conservative books. So it built HDB as a separate horse. And for years, HDB delivered. It scaled to a loan book of over ₹90,000 crores, turned profitable early and became HDFC Bank’s shadow arm in consumer and small business lending.\nNow, that arm is heading to the public markets with a\n₹12,500 crore IPO\n, priced between ₹700 and ₹740 per share. It’s set to be India’s biggest NBFC IPO yet. And naturally, that raises a question.\nWhy is HDFC Bank listing its NBFC arm now?\nWell, it’s partly because the regulators are nudging them to. RBI regulations recently mandated that ‘upper layer’ or big NBFCs must be publicly listed by\nSeptember 2025\n. Additionally, looming regulations may force banks to significantly cut stakes in lending subsidiaries. Today, HDFC Bank owns 94% of HDB, and post-IPO, its stake will shrink to around\n74%\n. So this IPO becomes an essential step to comply as well as give HDB a chance to unlock its own value.\nSpeaking of unlocking value, the math is simple: about ₹10,000 crores raised from the IPO is essentially a payday for HDFC Bank, which is selling part of its stake through an offer for sale (OFS). The remaining\n₹2,500 crores\nfrom fresh issue will meet HDB’s capital requirements and fuel lending growth.\nNow, to understand HDB’s business, you need to look at its three main segments where it lends money.\n1.\nEnterprise Lending (40% of HDB’s loan book): Provides secured and unsecured loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\n2.\nAsset Finance (37%): Secured loans for commercial vehicles, equipment and tractors.\n3. Consumer Finance (23%): Secured and unsecured loans for personal expenses, consumer goods and vehicles.\nBut to really understand why investors might love (or question) this IPO, let’s get under the hood of HDB’s operations.\nYou see, NBFCs, unlike banks, don’t accept customer deposits to lend money. Instead, they borrow from banks or markets and lend that money at higher rates, profiting from this margin. So the profitability hinges largely on two factors. How cheaply they raise capital. And how effectively they manage loan repayments.\nAnd that’s where HDB shines.\nFirstly, the parentage of HDFC Bank comes with perks, the biggest one being cheaper access to money. Banks trust the HDFC name, and by extension, trust HDB Financial, allowing it to borrow funds at relatively lower costs compared to rivals.\nSecondly, HDB has cracked a tough puzzle of going rural without compromising too much on quality. Over\n80%\nof its 1,700+ branches are in semi-urban or rural towns. Typically, loans in these regions carry higher risks, but HDB's phygital approach, cautious underwriting and diversification have kept loan defaults manageable. Its bad loans (or Gross NPAs) stand at around 2.26%. That’s reasonably healthy, though slightly higher than some top peers.\nThirdly, HDB Financial has mastered diversification. Unlike specialised NBFCs (think Muthoot Finance’s gold loans or Shriram Finance’s used-vehicle lending), HDB offers a broad credit portfolio—from personal loans to equipment financing. Think of HDB as a credit supermarket; when one product lending underperforms, another compensates, stabilising overall earnings.\nThis diversified model leverages India’s vast untapped credit market where only about 12% of Indians could access formal credit (as of 2021). HDB’s hyperlocal strategy positions it uniquely in this underserved segment. That’s why its loan book has grown from ₹70,000 crore as of FY23 to over ₹1 lakh crore in FY25, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% with profits and strong asset quality.\nBut this growth wasn’t all steady. When COVID struck, just like every other lender exposed to informal borrowers, HDB’s fortress began to crack. The loan book barely grew. Net profits took a hit and stayed stuck. And return on equity, a key measure of how well a company uses shareholders’ capital, dropped from 18% in FY23 to just 14% in FY25.\nAnd this slowdown wasn't accidental but strategic. You see, HDB turned cautious, pulling back from riskier segments, tightening underwriting norms, increasing loan-loss provisions, and downsizing its staff. It sacrificed aggressive growth for safer operations.\nNow, clear recovery signs are emerging. Net NPAs settled at a comfortable 1%, credit costs stayed around 2%. And its customer base has grown at a 25% CAGR in the last two years. Clearly, HDB is regaining its momentum.\nBut the problem could be the IPO price.\nAt the upper price band, the IPO values HDB at roughly\n₹61,000 crores\n, translating to a price to book (P/BV) multiple of 3.5.\nThat’s largely in line with the industry average of 3.6, but well below Bajaj Finance’s 5.9 times. Bajaj commands a premium for good reason. It delivers superior returns (20% ROE, 5% return on assets compared to HDB’s 3%), grows faster and carries a lower debt-to-equity ratio.\nOther NBFCs, like Shriram Finance, focus on riskier but higher margin loans, while Muthoot Finance thrives on the steady margin business of gold loans.\nCompared to these specialists, HDB Financial looks a bit vanilla. A balanced, diversified lender. It doesn't chase sky-high returns but doesn’t suffer from wild swings in asset quality either. It’s banking on steady, sustainable, and inclusive growth, which is a good thing.\nBut does that mean that it deserves a premium valuation just because it’s owned by HDFC Bank?\nMaybe, maybe not. That’s for the market to decide.\nThat said, there are a few risks as well. Even though asset quality has improved over time, bad loans have fluctuated between 1.9% and nearly 5% in recent years. They’ve inched up from about 1.9% to 2.2% in the last one year alone. Still low compared to many peers, but worth noting since 27% of HDB’s total loan book is unsecured. But HDB isn’t blind to this. It has been prudently keeping money set aside for potential bad loans, to cushion any impact. While this caution has slightly eaten into profits recently, it’s also a sign of responsible lending practices.\nThe near-term risks are clear too. Any broader economic downturn could hurt growth and cash flows. Asset quality, or managing those bad loans, is crucial too. Margins are slightly under pressure as borrowing costs rise. And with competition heating up, HDB will need to prove it can grow (from its current 2.2% market share) and improve efficiencies.\nAnd that’s why this IPO isn’t about quick wins. It’s a long-term play on a balanced and diversified financial institution with a massive runway for growth, especially in India’s underserved credit markets. It has the size, the numbers and the story.\nSo will you subscribe or sit this one out? Let us know!\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we explore how Siri might be holding Apple back in the AI (artificial intelligence) race, and whether that means it’s time to kill Siri already.\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to\nsubscribe\nand join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers.\nAlready a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\nThe Story\nExactly a year ago, Apple promised the world a ChatGPT-like Siri. But when the big reveal finally happened a few days ago, that futuristic Siri was nowhere to be seen. Instead, Apple announced a\ndeeper integration with ChatGPT\nitself, the very tool it partnered with last year.\nSo… what happened to the smarter, sassier Siri?\nWell, it looks like Apple may have lost it along the way. Because when people say, “Hey Siri, can you send a message please?” there’s often nothing but radio silence. And when it does respond, it’s rarely on the same page. For instance, Wall Street Journal journalist\nJoanna Stern\neven asked, “Hey Siri, are you still alive in there?” To which Siri blandly replied, “I’m Siri, your virtual assistant.”\nThat sure answers everything right? But hey, Siri was groundbreaking when it launched in 2011. So, what went wrong?\nTo understand that let’s go back to\nwhere it all began\n.\nSee, before Siri became Apple’s iconic voice assistant, it had a very different origin story. Back in 2003, a nonprofit research group called SRI International began working on a US government-backed AI project known as CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). Their goal was to build an assistant smart enough to learn from and adapt to its user.\nThat research eventually gave rise to Siri. In 2007, a few engineers branched out to launch Siri Inc., a startup focused on bringing this technology to consumers. By 2010, they released the Siri app for the iPhone. It let people do things like book cabs or make dinner reservations just by speaking to their phone. It was way ahead of its time.\nBut Siri Inc.’s independence didn’t last long. Within a couple of months, Apple stepped in and acquired it. The original team had plans to take Siri to Android and BlackBerry too, but Apple did something even smarter. It removed the app from the store and started building Siri directly into iOS.\nThen in 2011, Siri made its official debut on the iPhone 4S. You could talk to your phone like you were talking to a person. Siri answered questions, sent texts, set reminders and even cracked a joke or two. And that blew people away.\nBut now Siri seems to have failed to catch up.\nAnd the reason might be that Apple has always been more of a hardware giant than a software powerhouse. Sure, it built its own operating systems, but that was mostly by standing on the shoulders of\nMac OS X\n, a stable, well-built foundation that let Apple offer a seamless experience to users and developers alike. But as the tech world shifted towards AI and rapid-fire software updates, Apple found itself facing three big hurdles.\nFirst, Apple is a perfectionist. Really. It only ships products that meet its famously\nhigh standards\n. Clean design, minimalist interfaces, intuitive functionality — that’s the Apple way.\nBut in a world where new AI tools launch every other week, perfection can be a problem. The pace is too fast. The competition’s too bold. And waiting around for the perfect product could just mean getting left behind.\nSo when Apple started teasing the iPhone 16 with snazzy new features — like a smarter Siri that could use personal data (understanding things like “When is my next meeting with investors?”) and app context (for example, “Make this photo pop, and add it to the Goa 2025 vacation album”), or Apple Intelligence tools that summarise text, prioritise notifications, and edit photos — expectations ran high. But behind the scenes,\nengineers testing\nthese beta features found something troubling… they didn’t always work.\nSome even had to be rolled back after going rogue. Remember that summarisation feature that was supposed to help by condensing messages, news and notifications? It misfired pretty badly. There was this\none case\nwhere someone got a text from their mum saying, “That hike almost killed me!” The AI’s summary? “Attempted suicide but recovered and hiked in Redlands and Palm Springs.” That doesn’t sound great at all.\nThen there’s the fact that Apple hasn’t exactly been best friends with AI. You could say it’s been more cautious than curious. For years Apple largely refused to even use the word “AI”, until it did in a stubborn way by calling it “Apple Intelligence”. That might come from the fact that folks like Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, have reportedly been reluctant to throw big money at AI. For context, Apple has spent just $11 billion on capital expenditure over the past year. That’s barely about 15% of what its peers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta spent on average. Because from Apple’s point of view, it’s a high-risk game. Unlike hardware or traditional software updates where the outcome is more predictable, AI feels like a gamble. You pour in time and resources without knowing exactly what you’ll get in return.\nFederighi didn’t exactly see AI as a “must-have” for personal computers or smartphones either. He didn’t want to pull resources away from what Apple’s already great at — rolling out those polished, annual upgrades for iPhones, Macs and iPads. In AI, it’s common to dive in without a clear picture of the final product, figuring things out as you go. But that’s not Apple’s style. Apple tends to work with a destination in mind, building with purpose rather than experimenting aimlessly.\nThat mindset, along with its deep-rooted focus on user privacy, is probably what’s kept Apple from jumping in headfirst like Microsoft, Meta or Amazon, all of whom have either built or acquired large language models (LLMs) or AI chatbots.\nAnd that brings us to the biggest conflict — Apple’s famous commitment to privacy. Yup, it’s true that Apple’s privacy controls are far stricter than most of its competitors. But that strength also becomes a weakness when it comes to AI. Limiting the amount of user data it collects means Apple doesn’t have the same massive datasets that others rely on to train and improve their AI.\nEven with its new ChatGPT integration, Apple insists on user consent before sending off queries. And OpenAI doesn’t get to keep the data either. That’s great for protecting privacy, but it also makes it harder for Apple to catch up.\nWhich leaves us wondering — should Apple just kill Siri?\nLet’s face it, Siri’s reputation has taken quite a beating over the years. It’s been clunky, slow, and frustrating for users. And now, with Apple Intelligence in the mix, things have only gotten messier. Some\nbasic features\nthat used to work just fine, like sending a simple text, are suddenly glitchy. So maybe it’s time to stop clinging to the nostalgia of Siri and admit that the old assistant might be more of a burden than a badge of honour.\nMaybe what Apple really needs is a clean break and a total rebrand.\nAfter all, it\nwouldn’t be the first\nto do it. Google swapped out Assistant for Gemini. Microsoft shelved Cortana and bet big on Copilot. So why not Apple?\nOf course, Apple being Apple might want to hold on, stick to its identity, do things its own way and be the perfectionist.\nBut if that’s the path it wants to take, it needs to move faster. Because in the world of AI, the clock doesn’t wait. And the competition sure won’t either.\nUntil next time…\nP.S.\nAs we were putting this story together, rumours started swirling that Apple might be quietly exploring\nacquiring Perplexity AI\n. If that happens, it could turn out to be Apple’s biggest acquisition ever.\nWho knows… maybe they had a sixth sense that this story was coming. 😉\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "Hey folks!\nWhat if we told you that a tiny forest elf with a mischievous grin is helping power a multibillion-dollar company?\nYup, meet Labubu, a cute, quirky toy that’s taken the internet (and celebrity handbags) by storm. From Rihanna to K-pop stars, everyone seems to be flaunting one. And behind Labubu’s global rise is the Chinese toy retailer Pop Mart International, whose stock has shot up by over 180% this year, boosting its market value to a whopping\nHK$350 billion\n($44 billion).\nThat makes it the third most valuable intellectual property (IP) company in the world, right after Disney and Nintendo. Not bad company to keep, eh?\nNow, if you’re wondering ‘what on earth is Labubu?’, here’s the backstory. It’s a character that Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung created for his book series\nThe Monsters\nin 2015. And until 2019 Labubu was part of a fictional dinosaur-era species that lived in forests and were all-female elves.\nBut that changed when Lung teamed up with Pop Mart, giving it exclusive rights to turn his characters into collectible toys. Fast forward to 2024, and Labubu has gone from a hidden gem to a must-have collectible.\nSure, you could say that the ‘blind box’ strategy helped because some Labubus are rarer than others, and buyers don’t know which one they’re getting till they rip the box open. That element of surprise is undoubtedly addictive, especially for die-hard fans hunting for specific colours or designs.\nBut what people aren’t talking about is that Labubu’s rise wasn’t just luck or clever packaging. It was creative strategy.\nIn the early days, Pop Mart was just another startup trying to find its footing. Big-name IPs weren’t lining up to collaborate, and recognition was hard to come by.\nSo Pop Mart would\nvisit art fairs\nand watch which artist booths had the longest lines. That became their secret recipe for spotting future stars and building a killer IP portfolio.\nLabubu just happened to be one of those gems.\nBut while the world’s busy unboxing Labubu toys, here’s a thought — could Pop Mart’s success be China’s quiet diversification from manufacturing muscle to cultural trendsetting and soft power expansion?\nWe’ll let you ponder that over your Sunday coffee or chai. ☕\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nYeh Duniya Jala Do\nby Janisht Joshi\nThanks for this lovely recommendation, Naitik Dhanani! Keep the recs coming, folks!\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nJapan’s anime crisis\nWhat comes to your mind when someone says anime?\nProbably ‘cool Japan’ or that thing you binge on weekends. And you wouldn’t be wrong.\nAnime is big business. Just look at what happened during the pandemic. While Hollywood hit pause, Japan’s\nDemon Slayer: Mugen Train\nsliced through global box office records, raking in over $470 million. In 2023, the Japanese anime industry, including streaming and merchandise, hit a record\n¥3.34 trillion\n($23 billion). That’s a 14% jump from the year before!\nBut behind all the fandom and profits there’s a crisis brewing.\nJapan’s anime workforce is shrinking. The Japan Research Institute predicts that by 2030, the number of animators could fall nearly 30% from 6,200 in 2019.\nAnd we know what you’re thinking — If the money’s rolling in, why aren’t more people joining the party?\nWell, turns out, the working conditions aren’t exactly animated bliss.\nMost people join the industry for the love of the art. But reality hits hard. The work is grueling, the hours are long and the pay is pretty dismal.\nJust to put things in perspective, anime industry folks clock in around\n219 hours\na month. That’s way above Japan’s national average of 162 hours. And for comparison, Americans average about 176 hours a month. So yeah, that’s a lot of work.\nAnd they earn far less too. Entry-level animators in their early 20s take home less than ¥2 million a year, while the average young Tokyoite makes over ¥3 million. In the US, even beginner animators earn more than double that.\nWhy’s that?\nWell, part of the problem seems to be that most studios don’t own the anime they produce. Instead, they work under budget constraints set by production committees, made up of publishers, toy companies and media firms that finance the shows and share the royalties. Studios are just one cog in the wheel. So they outsource work to smaller firms, which then subcontract to even smaller ones and freelancers. Which means that revenue trickles down very slowly.\nThe end result is that streaming platforms and production houses cash in but the folks actually creating the anime don’t end up seeing much of that money. In 2023, while anime streaming revenues surged 51%, the production companies in Japan saw just a 6% bump. And this mismatch is breaking the backbone of the industry — the creators.\nThat means there are fewer hands on deck and with higher demand, Japan is outsourcing work to other countries and even considering AI to plug the gap.\nHere’s the catch though. If Japan stops being the heart of anime, the magic could fade too.\nAnd the Japanese government seems to have noticed that, which is why it passed a new law to improve protections for freelancers.\nBut there’s growing pressure to introduce tax credits for anime studios — something over 50 countries already offer their creative sectors, but is still missing in Japan.\nMaybe fixing that is what it will take for anime to start looking as good behind the scenes as it does on screen. What do you think?\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\n23rd of June, 1964 — When India helped rewrite global trade rules\nIn 1964, Geneva was buzzing with a summit. One where 120 countries gathered to ask a big question:\nCan global trade be fairer for developing nations?\nIt was the closing day of the\nfirst UN Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD). And India, led by economist Lakshmi Kant Jha, wasn’t just present but also leading the charge.\nYou see, in the two decades after World War II, the global economy was largely designed by and for the West. Rich countries set trade rules, fixed commodity prices and controlled capital flows through institutions like the IMF, World Bank and GATT (the predecessor to the WTO). But as newly independent countries like India entered the picture, they quickly realised something:\nThe rules weren’t made for them.\nSo when UNCTAD was launched in 1964, India and other post-colonial nations pushed for a new agenda that included fairer trade terms, better financing options, stable commodity prices and access to technology. They didn’t want aid but equity.\nUNCTAD’s big win? It formalised the idea of “Special and Differential Treatment” for developing countries. It laid the groundwork for concessional lending, tariff preferences and institutions like the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (\nGSTP\n) that still shape trade today.\nExactly 61 years later, UNCTAD’s 2025 World Investment Report puts India at the\n15th spot\nglobally for foreign direct investment, despite a tough global environment and flat year-on-year growth at $28 billion. What’s even more striking is that India topped Asia in capital expenditures for new projects.\nThat’s a full-circle moment.\nFrom demanding a voice in 1964 to becoming a serious magnet for global capital today, India’s journey mirrors UNCTAD’s vision: of levelling the trade field not through aid, but through agency.\nAnd the takeaway? It’s that the fight for a fairer trade system wasn’t won in one conference. But it started here. And as India builds digital public goods, attracts green investments and leads G20 and WTO talks, it’s no longer just asking for a seat at the table. It’s shaping the menu.\nReaders Recommend 🗒️\nThis week, our reader Brindha Srinivasan recommends reading\nThere Are Rivers in the Sky\nby Elif Shafak.

But one of you might have to give in… permanently!\nBecause the government wants to cap how cold or hot your AC can go. No cooler than 20°C. No warmer than 28°C.\nBut it’s not like they’re trying to settle our bedroom fights. The real reason seems to be that we’re using way too much electricity just to stay cool.\nBut is locking ACs at a certain temperature really the smartest way to tackle the electricity overconsumption problem? Or are there better, long-term fixes the government should focus on?\nFind out in our\nMonday newsletter\n.\nIs a war in the Middle East, a fertiliser crisis for India?\nYou walk into your neighbourhood kirana store a few months later. Pick up atta, oil, rice. And just as you reach for a packet of dal, you pause. ₹105. Last month it was ₹85. You sigh.\nYou’ve seen this before — and this time, you know the reason: a possible war simmering in the Middle East.\nBut wait… how does a conflict so far away affect your grocery bill?\nIf you guessed rising fuel prices making crop transportation costlier, think again. The real answer lies even closer to the crops — fertiliser.\nCurious how that works?\nCheck out our\nTuesday newsletter\nto find out.\nWhy Karnataka needs a bike taxi policy, and fast!\nPeople in Bengaluru are identifying themselves as parcels. The reason is simple. Bike taxis are technically banned in Karnataka. You can’t ferry passengers on private vehicles without a commercial permit.\nBut that hasn’t stopped people. Some bike taxi riders have simply switched categories from “passenger” to “parcel”.\nSo folks are now booking a ride as a package.\nNow, you could laugh at the jugaad. But the real question is: why are we even in this situation?\nWell, it seems like Karnataka’s government is in no rush to legalise things.\nBut hey, a proper framework to regulate bike taxis could bring in some decent revenue. So why not do it then?\nWe broke it down in\nWednesday’s newsletter\n.\nIs SEBI coming for Wall Street’s smartest trader?\nJane Street isn’t your average Wall Street name. But this low-profile hedge fund is ruffling feathers on Dalal Street.\nSEBI’s been digging into years of trades to figure out if Jane Street’s lightning-fast algorithms have been nudging India’s benchmark indices in ways that favour big players, while leaving retail traders in the dust.\nIs this smart strategy or market manipulation?\nThe answers lie in Thursday’s newsletter.\nClick here to check it out\n.\nOne Nation, One Time!\nIndia runs on IST.\nBut here’s the funny part. Most of our digital systems still take their time cues from foreign sources like the US GPS or Google’s servers. That’s risky. A tiny glitch could throw off banking, telecom, stock trades or even ATMs.\nSo now, India wants to fix that with One Nation, One Time. It’s a plan to build our own ultra-precise, satellite-synced, atomic clock network.\nBut will it work across a country as vast and diverse as ours?\nCheck out our\nFriday newsletter\nto read the full story.\nFinshots Weekly Quiz 🧩\nHere’s your chance to win some exclusive Finshots merch.

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we tell you about India’s push to sync every system to its own time and why it matters.\nPrefer listening instead? Whether you’re jogging, commuting, or just too lazy to read, tune in to listen to this story and more on\nSpotify\nor\nApple\npodcasts.\nAnd before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven't already. We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise!\nThe Story\nTwo aliens are recording a podcast.\nOne laughs, “So these humans… they literally invented this invisible thing called time!” The other clacks, “Right? They chopped up a day into 24 parts, then split each into 60, then 60 again… and now they worship it with alarms, deadlines and what not!”\nThe laughter now turns to wheezing.\nAnd as absurd as it sounds, they have a point. Time’s a man-made construct. The universe didn’t care about your 9-to-5, your birthday reminders or stock orders at 3:29 p.m. But once we built society on it, we needed everyone to agree. And that’s where things got messy.\nWe built clocks. Then atomic clocks. Then networks of clocks synced across satellites, servers, courtrooms, power grids and fighter jets. Every country made its own tweaks. The US has six time zones. Nepal decided to be 15 minutes off from India. And France, for some reason, has 12. But no matter the differences, the world runs on this invisible consensus. Miss a millisecond, and systems break.\nAnd yet, for all our obsession with time, India’s digital systems still run, ironically, on someone else’s clock.\nAnd that’s what the Indian government wants to fix with something called\nOne Nation, One Time\n. It’s a policy that seeks to anchor all of India’s digital and legal infrastructure to a single, ultra-precise, India-controlled time standard.\nThe idea is simple. Replace foreign time signals and GPS with India’s own atomic clocks, delivered through our own satellite system (which is the Navigation with Indian Constellation or\nNavIC system\n), and make sure everyone, from a railway server in a small town to a satellite uplink, runs on the same nanosecond-accurate clock.\nBecause right now, most of our systems from phones, payment gateways to telecom networks and even stock trading platforms, rely on time signals from\nforeign sources\nlike the US’ Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites or Google’s cloud servers. They’re fast, embedded into global tech stacks, and well, easy to use.\nOnly a few core systems like ISRO, DRDO, exchanges are directly synced to India’s own NavIC  satellite system. Everyone else is essentially winging it with third-party time feeds.\nAnd that can go horribly wrong.\nTake 2016, for instance. A GPS bug introduced a\n13-microsecond glitch\n. That’s just 0.013 seconds. But it broke parts of telecom networks, disrupted police radio in the US and threw off time-stamped data globally. High-frequency traders, who make millions off microseconds, felt it. In Europe, a timestamp issue in 2020 briefly knocked out services across TV and telecom.\nSo yeah, time may be invisible, but its absence isn’t.\nThat’s why India’s time needs to be its own.\nWe already have Indian Standard Time or IST. That’s Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) plus 5 hours and 30 minutes — a number chosen way back in 1906, based on a longitude near\nMirzapur\n, Uttar Pradesh. Today, it’s maintained by the National Physical Laboratory in Delhi using atomic clocks.\nThese clocks don’t run on gears or pendulums, but on the tiniest vibrations inside cesium-133 atoms. They “tick” at a steady rhythm — exactly\n9,192,631,770 times\nevery second. Count those ticks, and you’ve got one perfect second. The clocks are so precise that they’d be off by just one second every 30 million years!\nAnd with One Nation, One Time, the idea is to put that precision to use, across the country and systems, in real time.\nSo to make this work, the government is building a nationwide time network from scratch. It has set up five Regional Reference Standard Laboratories in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Faridabad and Guwahati. Each lab has super-accurate atomic clocks, all perfectly in sync. These act like local hubs, sending out India’s “true time” to nearby regions.\nThis time will power everything from banking and telecom to transport, energy and defence using special time-sharing systems called NTP (Network Time Protocol) and the even more precise PTP (Precision Time Protocol). The best part? These clocks will keep everything across the country accurate to within just 0.1 milliseconds.\nAnd soon, a new law — the Legal Metrology (IST) Rules, 2025, is expected to roll out. Once it does, businesses and institutions may no longer be allowed to use foreign time sources like GPS or cloud servers. Instead, they’ll have to rely only on Indian IST for everything from timestamping electricity bills to tracking e-commerce deliveries. In fact, the government has\nalready asked\nstock exchanges, SEBI and banks to discontinue use of alternative systems such as GPS.\nBut why is all this happening now, you ask?\nBecause in today’s world, time is infrastructure. Every millisecond matters when money moves digitally, data is tracked in real time or AI is making decisions on your behalf. If your systems don’t agree on time, they can’t agree on reality.\nAnd that’s dangerous. Especially when\nover 4 billion users\nstill rely on time signals from US-controlled GPS satellites. If GPS gets spoofed or jammed (as has happened in Ukraine and the Middle East) critical Indian systems like ATMs, air traffic control or even radar systems could go dark.\nCountries like the US and China know this. They’ve invested billions in secure, domestic time dissemination with ground-based backups, sector-specific traceability and even quantum experiments. The EU has similar initiatives with its global navigation satellite, Galileo.\nIndia, meanwhile, has relied on patchwork by syncing its clocks to global systems and hoping small errors won’t cause problems. And that’s the risk One Nation, One Time is trying to evade.\nBecause the economic costs of inaction are real too. A US report once pegged losses from poor time synchronisation at\n$1 billion\na day (in fraud, outages and errors). India doesn’t even track that number. But UPI delays, power grid losses and telecom billing errors already hint at it.\nOf course, building this backbone won’t be cheap. Setting up atomic clocks, building satellite redundancy, rolling out secure sync protocols — all of it could cost hundreds of crores. Just ask Europe. Their high-precision timekeeping initiative costs tens of millions of euros every year. And they already have a head start. India’s rollout will cost significantly more and it’s unclear if private sectors like banking or telecom will foot the bill to sync up.\nIntegrating it across sectors is a different challenge altogether. Because convincing thousands of institutions to upgrade, comply and stay compliant will be slow. And expensive.\nAnd then there’s the contradiction no one’s talking about.\nFor years, states like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have argued for a\nseparate time zone\n. The sun rises by 4:30 a.m. in winter there and sets before 5 p.m. But schools and offices still follow Delhi’s IST schedule. In fact, studies suggest that India loses up to\n2.7 billion units\nof electricity each year due to inefficient lighting caused by sticking to a single time zone. That’s over thousands of crores annually in wasted power.\nSo while One Nation, One Time might sound efficient, it’s also… paradoxical. We’re doubling down on one clock, while parts of the country argue that they need a different one altogether.\nA smarter solution might’ve been using the same atomic clock grid to support dual time zones — one for the rest of India, and one for the Northeast. That way, India gets precision and practicality. And as per some calculations,\n$4.1 billion\nin human capital gains.\nBut for now, the plan is singular. One time, one signal, one source.\nAnd while that raises questions — if time becomes centralised under one agency, who audits it? What’s the fallback during outages? Will it be more reliable than the current patchwork? — it also solves a bigger issue. It gives India control over its most underrated infrastructure: time.\nSo yeah, maybe aliens would laugh at humans for inventing time. But they’d stop chuckling if they saw a country trying to control it down to the nanosecond on its own terms.\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we follow a Wall Street quant from New York to Mumbai and ask whether its billion-dollar playbooks are quietly manipulating India’s most important indices.\nBTW, we’re on WhatsApp Channels too.\nClick here\nto join and get your daily dose of all things Finshots, straight to your WhatsApp!\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nNine out of ten traders in the derivatives market lose money. And if you’ve ever wondered who that elusive one-in-ten winner is, chances are it’s a firm like Jane Street.\nJane Street is a US-based quantitative hedge fund famous for its low-profile, high-return approach to trading. It uses high-frequency algorithms to execute billions of rupees worth of trades in milliseconds. But now, the firm is under the scanner of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\nSEBI has spent the past few months combing through the firm’s derivatives footprint on India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE). And they are tracing the last\nthree years\nof trades to see if outsized options positions on Nifty-50 and Bank Nifty stocks were paired with strategic trades that could have nudged benchmark index values by a few basis points, just enough for a quick arbitrage trade. The firm often appears on SEBI’s watchlist, which gets triggered whenever a trade crosses roughly\n₹1,000 crore\na day, and Jane Street’s India desk has reportedly breached that threshold rather often.\nAnd if this name rings a bell, it’s probably because Jane Street was involved in another controversy last year. Two employees left the firm for a rival, Millennium Management, and Jane Street ended up suing them (We even covered a story about it\nhere\n). This lawsuit revealed that Millennium Management made a billion dollars in profits from derivatives trading in India alone, while Jane Street earned over\n$2.3 billion\n. And that’s where the problem begins.\nWhy, you ask?\nWell, because derivatives such as futures and options are a zero-sum game. This means that for Jane Street or Millennium Management to make money, someone has to lose it. And SEBI’s hunch is that it is the retail players who might be handing over their chips. Not just because of bad timing, but because the table itself is tilted.\nLet’s explain.\nWhen a firm comes in with millions of dollars and takes an outsized position in the market, it is bound to move in a way that is favourable to them. At least for a few seconds.\nLet’s say Jane Street places a massive options bet that profits if the Nifty 50 index rises slightly within the next few minutes. Now, to improve the chances of that happening, they might also buy up just enough shares of a few companies in the Nifty index in the regular cash market. And this sudden buying can push the index up maybe by just a few basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%), but that’s often all it takes. Since the derivatives are highly leveraged, even a tiny move can result in a huge payout.\nAnd remember, Jane Street’s using ultra-fast algorithms to do all of this in milliseconds. So by the time a retail trader like you and I react, it’s already over. The big fish have already cashed out, and the rest of the crowd is left holding the bag.\nThat’s exactly what SEBI is worried about.\nBut to be clear, nothing in Indian law forbids a hedge fund from taking a large position if it clears margin rules. Liquidity, after all, is why Nifty options turned India into the busiest index options marketplace last year.\nIn fact, Jane Street’s defenders argue that their algorithms narrow the bid-ask spreads in derivative trades, absorb shocks, and let everyday traders enter or exit positions faster and cheaper. All of which benefits the market. Yet regulators worldwide have learned that speed and capital can morph into market power before anyone blinks.\nWhat grabs SEBI’s attention isn’t a single huge trade. Rather, it’s a repeated pattern—large derivative bets consistently followed by well-timed cash-market orders that can manipulate index levels.\nAnd the broader context matters too.\nYou see, the retail turnover for derivatives surged after the pandemic, trading app downloads skyrocketed, work-from-home hours freed up screen time, and weekly index expiries offered a thrill akin to playing the lottery. But a recent SEBI study also found that 89% of the retail traders lose money\n90%\nof the time.\nThis is why SEBI is trying to draw new boundaries. It’s working on a framework to monitor unusually concentrated positions in the derivatives market. It’s also checking whether large options trades are being paired with cash or spot market orders that nudge prices in a favourable direction. Brokers, on their part, are also preparing for tighter audits, algorithm disclosures, and stricter intraday position limits.\nBut there’s also the broader policy dilemma SEBI now faces.\nOn one hand India wants more foreign capital and global sophistication in its markets. But it also needs to protect its retail traders, many of whom are new, under-informed, and playing a dangerous game.\nThat’s why the regulator has floated ideas like a licensing exam for retail derivatives traders and\nmandatory registration\nfor retail algo trading. It has also ordered any retail algorithm that auto-punches orders to be registered and whitelisted, hoping to expose clandestine “copy trade” Telegram bots that piggyback on institutional flows.\nFor big guns like Jane Street, though, the more immediate headache could be tighter intraday position limits and mandatory third-party audits of trading code.\nExchanges are drafting rules that would force high-frequency firms to lodge versions of their algorithms, allowing for post-trade forensic replay if something looks fishy. Then again, experts warn that treating this code like potential contraband could drive capital to Singapore or Dubai.\nSo, amidst all this, what can you, as a retail investor, do to come out ahead?\nDo not venture into derivatives unless you’re ready to lose money. Stick to proven methods based on your risk appetite. It could be diversified mutual funds, index investing, or high-quality stocks held for the long term. Focus on building discipline rather than chasing quick gains.\nWhatever the outcome of the Jane Street probe, it’s clear the derivatives segment is set to change.\nIf regulators find the right balance with smarter surveillance, tighter guardrails, and clear accountability, India’s options market can remain vibrant and inclusive. But if regulation swings too far, the risk is that foreign capital and innovation simply move elsewhere. And that would be a loss not just for Jane Street, but Dalal Street too.\nUntil then…\nIf this story helped you see the markets a little clearer, share it on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\n, or\nX\nand help a friend decode Jane Street’s Indian adventure in three minutes."

                    "title": "Why Karnataka needs a bike taxi policy, and fast!",
                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we tell you why Karnataka desperately needs a policy framework on bike taxis.\nPrefer listening instead? Whether you’re jogging, commuting, or just too lazy to read, tune in to listen to this story and more on\nSpotify\nor\nApple\npodcasts.\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nThis week, Bengaluru’s traffic police cracked down on\nmore than 100\ntwo wheelers offering bike taxi services. After all, they were ferrying passengers on private bikes, which isn’t allowed under current rules. Because only vehicles with commercial registration and valid permits can be used to carry passengers.\nBut this didn’t happen overnight. The tussle between bike taxi aggregators and the state’s Transport Department has been simmering for years. Officials have repeatedly pointed out that personal two wheelers being used for paid rides are technically breaking the law.\nIn fact, Rapido, one of the biggest names in the game, did try to\nfight back\n. They went to court, hoping for a stay on the ban. But the High Court wasn’t convinced. And from Monday (June 16th), operators were forced to shut down bike taxi services across Karnataka or risk legal trouble.\nNow, you could say that this is a classic case of startups needing to do their legal homework before launching services. But it also raises a bigger question: Why didn’t Karnataka just create a policy to regulate bike taxis instead of banning them outright?\nIt’s not like there was no demand. In fact, bike taxis became a go-to option in post-pandemic Bengaluru. They were cheap and perfect for beating the city’s traffic snarls.\nBut not everyone was happy. Autorickshaw unions pushed back hard, calling for a total ban. The government did float an e-bike taxi policy in 2021, but it was rolled back last year over concerns about safety and misuse.\nAnd since then? Nothing.\nThe government hasn’t moved to set clear rules or bring in a fresh framework.\nThe end result was more crackdowns, more confusion, and a promising mode of urban transport stuck in regulatory limbo.\nFunnily enough though, if Karnataka brought in a proper framework to regulate bike taxis, it could pocket some decent revenue. Just think about it. The state has around\n1.2 lakh active bike taxi\nriders. Now, if each one had to pay a ₹1,000 permit fee to operate legally, that alone adds up to ₹12 crores a year. Toss in a few more lakhs from aggregator licenses and permits, and you’ve got a tidy sum.\nAnd that’s just the start.\nThe state gets about\n8 lakh rides\nevery single day. And if you factor in a 5% goods and services tax (GST) on an average fare of ₹50, and you’re looking at another ₹73 crores in indirect taxes annually.\nAll in all, the state could be letting go of around ₹85 crores a year. And sure, that might sound like a lot to you and me. But for the state it’s pocket change. We’re talking about less than 0.05% of what it already rakes in from motor vehicle taxes, permits, registrations, all the other transport-related collections and the state’s tax revenue put together.\nMaybe that’s why there’s no rush to legalise things. After all, there’s no major fiscal pressure.\nOn the flip side, it might be choosing to keep autorickshaw drivers happy, not just because they’re the backbone of the transport system, but also because they’re a\nsizeable votebank\nthe government can’t afford to upset.\nBut hey, that’s not really our territory to comment on. So we’ll stick to what we know ― that by holding back on long term regulation, the state might just be choosing a trade-off that could come back to bite.\nWhy’s that, you ask?\nBecause this ban isn’t just about business or side hustles, it’s about livelihoods. For context,\na KPMG report\nsays that most bike taxi drivers take up the job to cover emergency expenses or run their households. In fact, they contribute nearly 60% to the family income. And for a state that proudly boasts the lowest unemployment rate in India at just\n2.5%\nor half the national average, it’s not a great look to push thousands out of work and nudge up joblessness.\nThe bigger problem is also the precedent this sets. It sends a loud, worrying message to anyone building something new, that innovation might be shut down instead of shaped.\nThe thing is that startups thrive on clarity. They need predictable regulations to raise money, grow and experiment. But when a state like Karnataka pulls the plug on an entire category of business, just because there isn’t a rulebook in place, it spooks founders. It makes them think twice before launching or scaling anything in the state, for fear that they’ll run into the same dead end.\nAnd let’s not forget competition. On the surface, it may look like bike taxis are eating into the earnings of auto rickshaw drivers by offering cheaper short rides. But that’s how markets evolve. Quick commerce disrupted kiranas. But did we ban grocery delivery apps? No. We’re trying to regulate them. So why single out bike taxis?\nBesides, scrapping an entire segment doesn’t just reduce consumer choice, it also gives more pricing power to cab aggregators and auto drivers. With one less player in the mix, it becomes easier to hike fares or slap on surge fees, especially for short distances. And commuters are left with fewer and costlier options.\nSo the simple fix?\nRegulation. Other states have already shown the way.\nMaharashtra\nallows licensed operators with at least 50 electric bikes, with rules around GPS tracking, driver police verification, trip limits and mandatory passenger helmets. West Bengal is exploring short term authorisations of less than a year to let bike taxi drivers come and go from the profession easily. Even\nDelhi\npermits only e-bike taxis.\nSo yeah, regulation really does seem like the best middle ground.\nBecause if the government keeps dragging its feet, it’s not just missing out on a chance to organise the chaos, it might actually be hurting its own economy in the long run.\nAnd let’s be honest, bans don’t always work. Especially not in the world of\njugaad\n.\nSome bike taxi players are already finding clever workarounds. One of them seems to have come up with a genius loophole — if passengers aren’t allowed, what about parcels? So now, they’re labelling passengers as “\nparcels\n” and transporting them across the city like courier packages.\nTechnically, you can now parcel yourself to work!\nIt’s like the state’s trying to kill off bike taxis, but they keep coming back — resurrecting themselves each time like Lord Voldemort, just with more creative disguises.\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we tell you the story of how a war far away could quietly spike your grocery bill. Not through crude oil, but through something much humbler.\nBTW, we’re on WhatsApp Channels too.\nClick here\nto join and get your daily dose of all things Finshots, straight to your WhatsApp!\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nIt’s June. A farmer in eastern Uttar Pradesh is leaning on his bike outside the local cooperative store. He’s here to pick up urea (the fertiliser). Sowing begins soon, and the monsoon looks promising. But the dealer shrugs.\n“No stock yet. Maybe next week.” The farmer sighs because this isn’t the first delay.\nDown south, a trucker in Visakhapatnam looks over his delivery list. He’s supposed to transport imported potash from the port. But customs has flagged the container. Shipping costs have gone up. Insurance premiums too. And rumours are swirling about delays at Iran’s Bandar Abbas port.\nAt first glance, these seem like unrelated hiccups. But if you zoom out, you’ll spot the bigger trigger. Israel has just struck Iran. And with Iran retaliating, both countries are now on the brink of war. And of course, global markets are reacting.\nCrude oil prices are climbing\n.\nBut there’s another, quieter casualty: fertiliser.\nThat’s the connection few people think about.\nYou see, the world’s food system runs on three key ingredients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Together, they form NPK: the holy trio that feeds our crops. Nitrogen boosts photosynthesis and leaf growth, phosphorus strengthens roots and flowers and potassium improves drought and disease resistance.\nNow here’s the thing. To make these fertilisers, you need inputs from nature’s vault and a lot of industrial muscle. Nitrogen fertilisers (like urea and ammonium nitrate) are made by synthesising ammonia. And ammonia is made from natural gas. About 60% of production cost is just gas. Phosphorus fertilisers (like DAP and MAP) come from phosphate rock, which is mined and chemically processed using sulphur. And Potassium fertilisers (like potash) are dug straight from potash ore (large deposits of which exist only in a few countries).\nAnd guess who has plenty of those? Well, countries clustered around the Persian Gulf. Or countries that now sit at the edge of a potential war.\nThe Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) exports over 30% of the world’s nitrogen fertilisers. Countries such as Iran, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are awash with natural gas, sulphur and ammonia exports. Iran alone sends out\nover 16 million\ntonnes of urea each year.\nFor phosphate fertilisers, Morocco holds nearly\n70%\nof the world’s phosphate rock reserves.\nAnd when it comes to potash, the third pillar\n,\nRussia and Belarus used to supply nearly 40% of global capacity. But those supply lines have also been disrupted since the Ukraine war.\nWhich means all three pillars of NPK are geopolitically fragile. So most of what goes into making global fertiliser comes from conflict zones or countries one crisis away from sanctions or shipping bans.\nAnd not to forget fertiliser shocks are sneaky. They don’t show up at your fuel station next week. They hit with a lag of a few months. When urea prices rise, farmers use less. Or sow less. The harvest shrinks. Traders pay more. Food prices go up. And suddenly, your grocery bill gets slightly expensive.\nThat’s what economists call a second-order effect. And it’s happened before.\nIn 2008, fertiliser prices shot up as China restricted urea exports and commodity markets rallied. In 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions on Belarus, which together accounted for\n40%\nof global potash, sent nitrogen and potash prices through the roof. Global fertiliser prices\ndoubled\nin months.\nSri Lanka\nsaw a farm crisis. Ghana saw protests. Even in India, inflation ticked up quietly.\nSo yeah, we’re staring at that risk again today.\nAnd the problem is India isn’t self-reliant here. We use over\n60 million tonnes\nof fertilisers every year. But we import nearly\n30%\nof urea, over 90% of phosphates and\n100%\nof potash.\nTo shield farmers, the Indian government keeps prices artificially low. A 50 kg bag of urea still costs about\n₹250\n, even though global prices might suggest ₹3,000 or more. That gap is plugged by subsidies. But the bill is steep, about\n₹1.8 lakh crore\nin FY25. That’s why our fertiliser spending is budgeted at about\n70%\nof the total agriculture budget.\nSo when global prices rise, the government has two choices: absorb the cost and blow up the fiscal deficit, or let prices rise for farmers, which then passes down through food inflation. Either way, someone pays. Eventually, everyone does. And soon, it’s felt everywhere.\nSo what’s India doing about it?\nTo its credit, quite a bit.\nWe’ve signed long-term import deals with Saudi Arabia and Oman for urea, partnered with Morocco’s OCP Group (a state-owned phosphate rock miner) for phosphoric acid, revived dormant urea plants under a ₹70,000 crore plan, and diversified potash imports from Russia and Belarus to Canada and Jordan.\nWe also launched “\nOne Nation, One Fertilizer\n” to simplify branding and reduce logistics costs. And most ambitiously, we introduced “nano urea” — a liquid fertiliser developed by IFFCO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative) that claims to replace a 45 kg bag of urea with a 500 ml bottle. Over 8 crore bottles have already been produced. We’ve even deployed real-time tracking systems to monitor inventory movement.\nBut this is still a brittle system. Because while supply chains are being diversified, demand is still distorted.\nWe still use fertilisers far more indiscriminately than other countries. Urea is overused simply because it’s the most subsidised. The ideal NPK use ratio is 4:2:1. But in many states, it’s as skewed as\n10:4:1\n. Overuse brings diminishing returns and damages soil health.\nIn the end, fertiliser becomes a budgetary black hole. Every global shock forces India to either borrow more or cut elsewhere. And that’s unsustainable.\nSo how do we tackle this, you ask?\nIn the short run, India will likely increase buffer stocks, scout new suppliers and maintain high subsidies.\nBut in the long run, we need a shift — not just in supply, but in demand reform. Subsidies could be tied to crop needs. States must be nudged to balance usage — like under the PM-PRANAM scheme, which rewards reduced chemical use. Precision farming, soil testing, and even caps on per-acre use can build long-term resilience.\nExperts also favour\ndirect cash transfers\nover price subsidies. That way, farmers get the money directly, can choose nutrients wisely, and avoid distorted demand.\nChina\ntried this a decade ago and it did boost yields by a margin.\nBut these are long games. And wars aren’t.\nShips and fertiliser bags are still moving. Prices are just slightly up. But history shows how fast that can change — one blockade, one strike, one clause.\nAnd then it trickles down.\nYou walk into your neighbourhood kirana store. Pick up atta, oil, rice. And when you reach for a packet of dal, you pause. ₹105. Last month it was ₹85. You sigh. You’ve seen this before. You pay the bill, head home, and forget about it.\nThat weekend, a headline scrolls past: “Crude oil steady despite Middle East tensions.”\nYou smile briefly. But then you remember. The oil wasn’t the real story this time. It was also the rejig in fertilisers.\nUntil then…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "title": "Is 'one nation, one AC temperature' a good idea?",
                    "content": "In today’s Finshots, we dive into the government’s plan to standardise air conditioner temperatures between 20℃ and 28℃, and whether it makes sense.\nPrefer listening instead? Whether you’re jogging, commuting, or just too lazy to read, tune in to listen to this story and more on\nSpotify\nor\nApple\npodcasts.\nAlso, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then\nhit subscribe\nif you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.\nThe Story\nIf you and your siblings or your partner have a nightly ritual of squabbling over the AC temperature, chances are you fall into one of two camps. You’re either Team 18°C or Team 24°C. And that means someone’s probably sleeping a little uncomfortable every night.\nBut that long-standing cold war might soon come to an end.\nBecause the government is\nplanning to standardise AC temperatures\nacross India. Under this proposal, air conditioners will no longer cool below 20°C or heat above 28°C. In short, one of you is going to have to compromise… for life.\nNow of course, the government doesn’t care about our bedtime temperature fights. What it’s really worried about is how much electricity we use by setting the AC too low.\nBecause you see, air conditioner ownership in India has\ntripled\nsince 2010. That’s 24 ACs per 100 households today, driven by rising heat and growing incomes. And with it, electricity demand for cooling has surged by 20% between 2019 and 2022. In fact, nearly 10% of all electricity used in India now goes toward keeping us cool.\nSo the Union Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs, Manohar Lal Khattar, floated an idea — mandate temperature caps in all new ACs.\nAnd if you think about it, there’s logic behind it.\nMost people assume that ACs create cold air. But\nwhat they actually do\nis pull heat out of your room and release it outside.. The refrigerant inside the AC absorbs heat from the warm indoor air and turns into a gas. This gas goes through a compressor that heats it up to nearly 90°C, and then it’s cooled and cycled back in. And that compression step uses the most electricity. Which means, the lower the temperature you set, the longer the compressor has to work to get the job done.\nIn fact, ACs are most efficient when set around 24–26°C. Below that, the system struggles. The refrigerant has to do more extreme heating and cooling, which sucks up more energy.\nWhat’s even more interesting is that most ACs can’t actually cool your room to 18°C on a hot summer day. They’re typically designed to\ncool about 10°C below\nthe outdoor temperature. So if it’s 36°C outside, you’ll be lucky to get the room down to 26°C. But set the AC to 18°C and it’ll just keep running endlessly, trying to hit a number it can’t reach.\nIt gets worse when it’s humid. In places like Mumbai, ACs first have to strip the moisture from the air before they can cool it. That dehumidifying process eats up 30–50% of the energy. And with outdoor temperatures climbing upward, compressors start losing efficiency. They work harder but cool less.\nSo yeah, setting the AC to extreme lows drains electricity. And that’s what the government wants to change.\nAccording to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), raising the AC temperature setting from 20°C to 24°C can slash power consumption by 24%. For every degree increase, you save about 6% in electricity. Over three years, this could save\n₹18,000–20,000 crores\nin bills and cut down carbon emissions significantly.\nAnd it’s not like India’s doing this in isolation.\nItaly, Spain, Greece and Japan have all implemented or encouraged similar measures. Italy’s “Operation Thermostat” enforces a 27°C minimum in public buildings, with penalties for non-compliance. Spain mandates the same for public spaces. And Japan recommends 28°C in offices, though it isn’t enforced by law.\nSo why is India’s potential plan facing backlash?\nWell, because our challenges are different.\nThe West or temperate countries don’t deal with the kind of heat and humidity we do. A uniform temperature cap sounds great on paper, but it doesn’t address deeper issues.\nStart with the roads. Over 95% of India’s surfaced roads are made of asphalt. It’s a cheaper, more flexible material. But asphalt absorbs and radiates heat, driving up local temperatures.\nA potential fix?\nCool pavements\n. These are surfaces that reflect more sunlight and retain less heat. In Los Angeles, trials showed a 10-degree drop in surface temperatures in areas with cool pavement coating. Even in Mumbai’s\nThane\n, local authorities are experimenting with white paint to reflect heat off streets.\nImagine if this was implemented across cities. There would be less heat absorbed and lower demand for cooling.\nAnd then there’s the architecture itself.\nWalk through any Indian metro and you’ll see glass-clad buildings shimmering under the sun. They look swanky, but\nthey’re terrible for our climate\n. Glass traps heat like a greenhouse. The interiors get warmer, so we crank up the AC. That cools the inside but dumps more hot air outside, heating up the surroundings even more. It’s a vicious loop.\nWestern countries with colder weather can afford glass buildings. But we can’t. Using materials like bricks or clay, or even tweaking building designs with thicker walls or shaded balconies, can help a lot.\nIn fact, India’s own architectural heritage has solutions.\nTake the\nclassic jaali\n— those beautifully patterned stone screens you see in Mughal-era buildings like the Taj Mahal. They’re not just decorative. They use a principle called the Venturi effect. When air passes through small openings, it speeds up and loses pressure, which cools it down. To understand this try blowing air on your hand with your mouth wide open, then do it again with pursed lips. The second one feels cooler, right? That’s exactly how jaalis work.\nModern buildings are picking up on this too.\nThe Microsoft office\nin Noida uses jaali-inspired screens to bring in natural light while keeping interiors cooler. This, combined with energy-efficient systems, has earned the building a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum rating — the highest sustainability certification there is.\nSure, stone or clay buildings may cost more today. But the government could fund research to develop cost-effective, heat-resistant materials inspired by traditional architecture. It would be a smart investment toward energy savings.\nAnd while we’re talking about affordability, there’s another angle worth exploring that a story in\nThe Morning Context\npoints out.\nRight now, air conditioners fall under the 28% GST slab because they’re classified as luxury goods. But given that cities like Delhi often feel like it’s baking at over 50°C, calling ACs a luxury sounds a bit outdated. This tax burden pushes people to buy cheaper, less efficient models.\nBut what if we changed that?\nWhat if taxes were tied to the AC’s energy efficiency? Say, based on the ISEER rating, which measures how much cooling an AC delivers for each unit of electricity consumed. A higher ISEER rating means better efficiency. If taxes were lower for high-ISEER ACs, people would naturally gravitate towards them. It would make efficient models more affordable and accessible, cutting both bills and carbon footprints.\nSo yeah, the idea of standardising AC temperatures isn’t a bad idea. But it shouldn’t be the only card on the table.\nIf the government really wants to reduce energy consumption from cooling, it needs a broader approach by rethinking how we build cities, roads, homes and even tax policies.\nLet’s just hope they’re listening.\nUntil next time…\nDon’t forget to share this story on\nWhatsApp\n,\nLinkedIn\nand\nX\n."

                    "content": "Hey folks!\nOver fifty years ago, sending a letter in India felt like playing a nationwide guessing game.\nBack in the day, postmen had to\nrely on memory\nto sort mail. They had to navigate over 23,000 post offices, figure out whether ‘Ashoknagar’ referred to the one in Karnataka or West Bengal, and hoped incomplete addresses somehow reached the right door. Sounds like chaos, right?\nThat’s why in 1972, India rolled out a game-changer — the humble 6-digit PIN code. Crafted by Shriram Bhikaji Velankar, this simple system brought order to the madness. Each digit had a role — region, sub-region, district and finally, your local post office. Suddenly, letters found their destinations faster, and the Post Office could even promote savings schemes more efficiently.\nSo it wasn’t just about mail, it was about building trust, access and financial literacy.\nFast forward to today, and the PIN code is still very much alive and kicking. But just recently it got a high-tech companion — the DIGIPIN.\nIndia Post, with help from IIT Hyderabad and ISRO’s NRSC, has launched DIGIPIN — a 10-character digital code tied to a tiny 4x4 metre square on the map. It’s like giving every doorstep in the country a unique digital ID. Especially handy for places with vague or missing addresses.\nBut don’t worry, the old PIN code isn’t going anywhere. It’s just been digitally upgraded with geofencing and smarter boundary mapping. And if you’re wondering why, well, it’s about making addresses smarter. With better accuracy, deliveries are quicker, emergency services respond faster and apps can serve you more precisely.\nIt’s all part of building a postal system that’s sharper, more reliable and ready for the future. One that doesn’t just help India Post, but anyone relying on accurate location data — be it businesses, developers or people delivering to folks like us waiting for a parcel.\nJust when we thought an age-old system couldn’t innovate anymore, it’s pretty cool to see how it’s still keeping up with the times, eh?\nHere’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵\nDread\nby Yesterdrive\nReady to dive in?\nWhat caught our eye this week 👀\nNo needles for blood tests\nSome people faint, some look away, some pretend they’re fine while secretly cursing the lab technician’s entire family. Because no one is thrilled getting poked with a needle to get some blood drawn.\nBut what if you didn’t have to? Imagine walking into a hospital, sitting down for a minute and getting a full-body health check… with nothing more than a selfie. Yup! That’s what just\nhappened in Hyderabad’s\nNiloufer Hospital that became the first in India to roll out an AI-based, non-invasive blood diagnostic tool called\nAmruth Swasth Bharath\n.\nSo how does this thing work?\nWell, the tech behind it is something called Photoplethysmography or PPG in short. In simple terms, it measures how light reflects off your skin and then tracks tiny changes in your blood flow just below the surface. These light changes are then decoded by AI to estimate your blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiration, hemoglobin A1c (the diabetes marker) and even nervous system stress levels. All of this happens in under half a minute!\nThis could be a big deal because India still struggles with basic\ndiagnostic access\n. In rural areas, one of the biggest hurdles in healthcare is not medicine, but testing. As per the National Health Profile 2023, only 12% of primary health centers (PHCs) have diagnostic labs and many of which don’t meet the basic standards. And the result, as an Economic Times story puts it is\n‘...a massive diagnostic gap in rural India, pushing patients toward unregulated, low-quality private labs. The consequences are severe: delayed or missed diagnoses, prolonged disease burden, high out-of-pocket costs, and ultimately, preventable deaths’\n.\nAnd there’s a market angle too. Globally, the non-invasive diagnostics market is booming and while Western startups are betting big, India’s approach is refreshingly different in terms of affordable, mobile-first and made for public health at a mass scale.\nSure, there are gaps. Accuracy, data privacy and large-scale reliability are still being tested. But for a country that produces over\n700 tonnes\nof biomedical waste daily, much of it from single-use syringes, vials, and cotton swabs — even reducing diagnostic waste is a win.\nSo no, we might not be tossing out blood labs tomorrow. But as a first-level screener, this could be revolutionary.\nFewer needles, faster results and maybe a future where you don’t need to look away :)\nWould you trust a blood test that doesn’t need your blood?\nInfographic 📊\nThis Day in Financial History 📜\n12th of June, 2000 – Index derivatives enter Indian markets\nAt the turn of the millennium, Indian markets were still warming up to the idea of modern financial instruments. While countries like the US had been trading derivatives for decades, India’s regulatory ecosystem was still cautious, especially after the Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh scams that exposed gaping holes in oversight and transparency.\nBut reforms were brewing. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), keen to bring Indian markets up to global standards, finally gave the\ngreen light\n. And on this day, the NSE launched\nindex futures\non the Nifty 50, officially kickstarting India’s exchange-traded equity derivatives market.\nIt was a small beginning. Just one instrument, limited participants and lots of skepticism. But it set the ball rolling. Within a year, index, stock options and single-stock futures were added. Soon after, BSE joined in too. And over time, derivatives went from niche to mainstream, offering investors powerful tools to hedge risk, speculate or simply gain leverage.\nToday, India has one of the world’s most active\nderivatives markets\n. And it all began with a single futures contract, launched on this day, 24 years ago.\nReaders Recommend 🗒️\nThis week, our reader Chirag Jain, recommends reading ‘\nMargin of Safety\n’ by Seth Klarman.

We were importing them from Israel and hoping DRDO’s shelved projects would someday take off.\nThen came the 2021 Jammu drone attack. And it changed everything. Today, Indian companies are developing world-class counter-drone systems — from jammers to AI domes. And they’re cheaper than Western tech too. Even Taiwan wants to buy them from us.\nBut the tech is still dependent on imported components, and defending against drones is always costlier than building them. So, will India lead the global counter-drone wave or just stay relevant? Find out in our\nMonday newsletter\n.\nDid India just cut global poverty?\nA few days back, the World Bank raised the International Poverty Line from $2.15 to $3/day. That should’ve added 226 million people to the global poor list.\nBut it didn’t. It added just 125 million. And the big reason? India.\nTurns out, India’s new household consumption survey painted a far more optimistic picture than expected, thanks to improved methodology, better data collection and real on-ground progress through welfare and infrastructure.\nBut how did it all add up and what does it tell us about how updated data can change global narratives? Check out\nTuesday’s story\nto find out.\nAre COVID-era bills finally coming to bite us back?\nBetween January and March 2025, five big micro-lenders wrote off ₹2,440 crores worth of loans.\nThat’s 8x more than last year. And the kicker is that these weren’t new defaults. They were pandemic-era loans that had been quietly rolled forward all this while.\nNow, with the RBI cracking down on predatory interest rates and multiple lending, micro finance institutions are being forced to clean house, not just for fresh lending, but to stay in business.\nBut is this a true reset or just another coat of paint on an old crack? Our\nWednesday newsletter\nanswers this and much more.\nIs NHAI selling the family silver to keep building roads?\nNHAI is sitting on a ₹3.5-4 lakh crore highway asset base. And instead of borrowing more, it’s come up with a new monetisation strategy for these assets — auctioning toll rights, selling InvIT units and securitising toll revenue.\nSo far, this strategy has helped it prepay loans, reduce debt and raise over ₹1.4 lakh crores. But here’s the concern: Once the high-traffic roads are all sold, who’s going to fund the next phase of highway construction?\nThat’s something we unpacked in\nThursday’s story\n.\nWhy doesn't India have its own Big 4?\nDeloitte. PwC. EY. KPMG.\nThey dominate global advisory and auditing — and India too. But why hasn’t India produced its own Big 4 equivalent?\nWell, outdated rules, advertising bans and a lack of scaling mindset have kept firms local. Even new ICAI reforms haven’t solved the deeper structural issues.\nAnd unless firms get more freedom, especially to collaborate, modernise and build a brand, we may keep asking this question again.
