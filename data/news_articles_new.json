If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>How would you feel if something that died over 12,000 years ago suddenly came back to life?</p><p>Well… it sort of has. Or at least, something close enough to it, that no one in history has ever pulled off before.</p><p>Scientists at an American biotech company called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/science/colossal-dire-wolf-deextinction.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Colossal Biosciences</u></a> have almost revived the dire wolf, one of the most successful Ice Age predators that vanished after losing much of its prey, most likely thanks to human hunting.</p><p><em>Sidebar:</em> You’re probably familiar with these majestic, powerful white creatures if you’ve watched <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>Now, when we say “almost revived”, it’s because this isn’t exactly the same animal coming back. Even though it’s been marketed as ‘de-extinction’, what the scientists have actually done is a bit different. They’ve used a cutting edge gene editing tool called CRISPR to modify the DNA of modern grey wolves. Then pieced together a full dire wolf genome using ancient DNA dug up from fossils that had been sitting in the earth for thousands of years. And finally, implanted these embryos into surrogate dogs.</p><p>What’s interesting here is that dire wolves and grey wolves aren’t even close cousins. They split apart on the evolutionary tree somewhere between 2.5 to 6 million years ago. So yeah, these new pups, named Remus, Romulus and Khaleesi (because of course), are <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2475407-no-the-dire-wolf-has-not-been-brought-back-from-extinction/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>about 99.5%</u></a> genetically identical to the original dire wolves.</p><p>And since that’s close enough, we’ll just call it de-extinction for now.</p><p>But why even do this, you ask?</p><p>In simple terms, it’s about saving the planet. Every year, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90862287/the-business-case-for-reversing-extinction?ref=finshots.in\"><u>around 30,000 species</u></a> quietly disappear. And even if you don’t notice it, the consequences are huge. Over half of the world’s economy or about $44 trillion relies on nature for food, raw materials, fuel and more. So when we lose species, we’re not just losing biodiversity; we’re losing the natural services that power economies, which could cost the global economy more than $5 trillion every single year.</p><p>To put it in starker terms, in the words of Dr. Jill Atkins and Barry Atkins, who wrote <em>Around the World in 80 Species</em>,</p><blockquote><em>Extinction, at its current rate, will ensure that financial markets will collapse, which will happen shortly before extinction of the human race if no urgent action is taken.</em></blockquote><p>So yeah, preserving what’s left matters. And one way to learn how, is by bringing back what’s already gone. By studying revived species, scientists can pinpoint the exact genes responsible for traits that help animals survive in tough environments. That knowledge might give us clues to help endangered species adapt to a rapidly changing climate.</p><p>Not just that. Releasing genetically engineered animals like woolly mammoths back into the wild could even slow down climate change. We know that sounds crazy, but mammoths could help preserve the rapidly melting permafrost in the Arctic by trampling down snow and encouraging grasslands to grow (we’ve written about it <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/can-the-woolly-mammoth-save-us-from-global-warming/\"><u>here</u></a>). That’s also why Colossal isn’t stopping with dire wolves or mammoths. They’re eyeing other long-lost creatures like the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo too.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Everything we’ve talked about so far is a business pitch Colossal has built around this whole idea of de-extinction. It makes it sound like a win for the planet. And it’s clearly working. Venture capitalists seem to be sold on the dream, valuing the company at a jaw-dropping <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/colossal-biosciences-raises-200m-at-10-2b-valuation-to-bring-back-woolly-mammoths/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVycGxleGl0eS5haS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMnPFy932uO2X1bgOq9ECxetg4BemQStrW6gJOgcrPb2UddMV0Tv4SyLbOyFMrJO-913-e94nJDWCCJnLqc5ppPZaqVCRourjzgFP3rTiZz2E04qboFwgYSvGfgXjs0vlhgvP98lM2S4JBwgBYVuafBZV7qmIy70__ZIg9VCUhZR&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>$10.2 billion</u></a>!</p><p>But our question is — is this really worth the money?</p><p>Let’s think this through. Some of the species Colossal wants to revive might eventually be rewilded. The dire wolves, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyz8qS6piQY&amp;t=2s&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>won’t be released</u></a> into the wild. They’ll stay inside a 2,000 acre preserve with round the clock care, and for now, they won’t be allowed to breed either. But for other species, like the red wolf or the woolly mammoth, Colossal hopes to eventually let them roam free.</p><p>And when those animal populations grow, guess who’ll foot the bill? Regional governments. The same ones already struggling to fund existing conservation projects. For perspective, the world currently spends just 17% of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-wildlife-day?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$824 billion</u></a> needed each year for biodiversity conservation. Which means we’re already 83% short.</p><p>And researchers are worried about this too. A <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:16404d70-f0f9-4412-bb32-ae19dd235c4f?ref=finshots.in\"><u>study</u></a> published in <em>Nature Ecology and Evolution</em>, a peer reviewed scientific journal, dug into what it would actually cost to look after resurrected animals. They used data from New South Wales, Australia and New Zealand, which carefully track conservation costs for endangered species, and applied those numbers to de-extinct animals. For example, looking after a woolly mammoth would likely cost as much as caring for an endangered Asian elephant.</p><p>But these estimates don’t include the massive up-front costs of bringing these animals back in the first place. So, even on paper, it’s a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/bringing-extinct-species-back-dead-could-hurt-not-help-conservation-efforts?ref=finshots.in\"><u>grim picture</u></a>.</p><p>The researchers even mapped out two scenarios — one where the government takes on the responsibility, and another where private companies sponsor it. In the first case, pulling money from existing conservation budgets to fund these de-extinct creatures would actually reduce overall biodiversity. In fact, for every species revived, about two existing ones could go extinct because of underfunding!</p><p>And this would only make an already skewed system worse. If you didn’t know, most of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/wildlife-biodiversity/wildlife-conservation-funds-biased-against-smaller-species-as-larger-animals-take-lions-share-study?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=A%2025%2Dyear%20study%20has%20uncovered%20that%20the,critically%20important%20animals%20and%20plants%20significantly%20underfunded.&amp;text=It%20found%20stark%20disparities%20even%20within%20vertebrate,mere%202.8%20per%20cent%20of%20the%20funding.\"><u>conservation money</u></a> goes towards bigger, more ‘charismatic’ animals. And because of that, many equally important animals and plants get left behind. To give you an idea, even within the vertebrate family, a staggering 85% of resources go to birds and mammals, while poor amphibians get just 3% of the funding. So imagine how lopsided it might get once woolly mammoths and dire wolves start grabbing the spotlight.</p><p>Also, economics aside, ecosystems have evolved without these animals. So it’s unclear whether they’ll thrive in today’s world or upset the delicate balance of species already there. <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:f173b561-b555-4c65-b011-1cbe72680f97?ref=finshots.in\"><u>A study</u></a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, another peer reviewed journal on natural sciences, tried to estimate how many woolly mammoths the modern Arctic could actually handle. The answer was between 48,000 to 72,000, which is still an optimistic upper limit. But even if numbers stay lower, there’s still a risk of them clashing with species like caribou and muskoxen for food or simply struggling to cope with a world they no longer recognise.</p><p>And that feels a bit like going around your elbow to get to your mouth. If current conservation projects get neglected in favour of flashy de-extinction ones, we might end up worsening biodiversity loss and the economic crisis it fuels.</p><p>But for Colossal, it’s not just about saving nature. It’s business. They could be making billions by bringing back long-lost animals and calling it conservation. If Colossal manages to successfully resurrect and reintroduce any of these species into the wild, they’re hoping to cash in by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/colossal-biosciences-raises-200m-at-10-2b-valuation-to-bring-back-woolly-mammoths/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVycGxleGl0eS5haS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMnPFy932uO2X1bgOq9ECxetg4BemQStrW6gJOgcrPb2UddMV0Tv4SyLbOyFMrJO-913-e94nJDWCCJnLqc5ppPZaqVCRourjzgFP3rTiZz2E04qboFwgYSvGfgXjs0vlhgvP98lM2S4JBwgBYVuafBZV7qmIy70__ZIg9VCUhZR&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>selling biodiversity credits</u></a>, a market based system kind of like carbon credits, where companies or countries pay for actions that help balance out environmental damage.</p><p>On top of that, government partnerships could open up another money making avenue. Right now, Colossal offers its conservation technology to governments for free. But with some countries already reaching out for help to save their endangered species, it’s not hard to imagine a future where those services come with a price tag.</p><p>Would Colossal make the same billions by focusing only on saving the species we already have? Probably not.</p><p>So yeah, while it’s undeniably cool, this whole de-extinction thing might be playing a dangerous game with nature and money. And we might need to take a cautionary lesson from <em>Jurassic Park</em>, the movie that warned us about this very thing decades ago.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A+story+that+breaks+down+the+economics+of+de-extinction.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F0rf1wj&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F37hcpn&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F97y9nx&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=A+story+that+breaks+down+the+economics+of+de-extinction.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

                    "content": "<section class=\"gh-content gh-canvas\">\n<p>Hey folks!</p><p>Some people lose money in the stock market. Others? Well… they lose 25 kilograms of cow ghee in an Uber.</p><p>Yup! Uber just dropped its latest edition of the Lost and Found Index this week, and it’s wild (also funny). Bags, wallets, phones, are predictable things to leave in an Uber. But a bansuri (flute), a gold biscuit, a wedding saree and even a gas stove made the list this year. And while Delhi has finally stepped down from its forgetfulness throne, passing the crown to Mumbai, there’s been another shuffle too. Hyderabad has dropped off the list, making room for Kolkata’s grand entry into the top five.</p><p>What’s even better is that people are most likely to misplace things at 7 pm, mostly on Saturdays. No surprises there. And if it’s a festive day, well… let’s just say Uber drivers probably double as unofficial lost and found officers.</p><p>Anyway, while people are busy losing things in Ubers, let’s make sure we aren’t misplacing any interesting, unusual business stories this week.</p><p>On that note, let’s dive in.</p><p><strong>Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8dKVbP1Nzo&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Something Stupid</u></a> by Lola Marsh</p><p>We normally like picking songs from underrated Indian artists, but this recommendation by our reader Amit Kumar Eshore was worth breaking the mould for. Thanks, Amit!</p><p><strong>What caught our eye this week 👀</strong></p><p><em>The bee-conomy is crashing and so are nature’s smallest workers</em></p><p>I used to think honeybees were the villains of my childhood.</p><p>One sunny afternoon, while playing outside, I got stung on the finger. Which ballooned up like a cartoon thumb, and I swore vengeance (well, at least a week of grumbling). But then, on the way to the doctor, my uncle told me something that changed everything. “Those bees you’re mad at? They’re the heroes of the food world”, he said.</p><p>He gave me an analogy of how bees were like the unpaid interns of our planet’s kitchen. Because these tiny creatures pollinate most of the world’s flowering plants (over 75% today) — fruits, veggies, nuts, even your morning coffee. They have a big production value (of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/scientists-warn-severe-honey-bee-losses-2025-rcna198141?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$350</u></a> million in 2023 alone). So without them, grocery shelves would look bleak, and diets would turn bland.</p><p>But here’s the stinger. Bees are vanishing. This winter, commercial beekeepers in the US lost nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/honeybees-deaths-record-high?ref=finshots.in\"><u>60%</u></a> of their colonies. That’s the biggest collapse since tracking began in 2011, affecting over two-thirds of managed bees. And the fallout is already showing. California’s almond orchards (home to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/honeybee-deaths-pollinated-foods-b2730292.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>80%</u></a> of global almond production) are facing pollination shortfalls.</p><p>And what’s weird is that scientists still don’t know the exact cause. Virus? Pesticides? Climate stress? Probably all of it.</p><p>But this isn’t new. Since the early 2000s, we’ve seen a rise in something called Colony Collapse Disorder, where entire hives vanish without warning. One big reason? Bees are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/honeybee-deaths-pollinated-foods-b2730292.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>starving</u></a>. Erratic weather messes with blooming cycles, and when flowers don’t appear on time, bees go looking and don’t make it back. Throw in pesticide exposure, and it’s a disaster waiting to happen. Meanwhile, the ongoing USDA budget and funding cuts have slowed crucial research and support for beekeepers.</p><p>It’s not just bees either. Insects overall like butterflies, beetles and ants are vanishing fast. These little guys are vital to food production, plant growth and waste breakdown. And their disappearance is nature’s giant red flag.</p><p>But here’s something that caught our attention…</p><p>The US has a record <a href=\"https://www.thetravel.com/why-over-a-million-bee-colonies-died-in-winter-2024/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>3.8 million</u></a> honeybee colonies. But beekeepers are simply cloning hives to keep up. Think of it like making copies of a sick patient and hoping one survives. Some are turning to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/nx-s1-5349649/mason-bee-honeybee-pollination?ref=finshots.in\"><u>mason bees</u></a>, who pollinate better but they don’t produce honey or live in hives (perhaps the reason for their low adoption among beekeepers).</p><p>And yeah, this isn’t just America’s problem. India, too, has had its brushes with <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/839067/bees-are-disappearing-in-india-and-we-are-slowly-learning-why?ref=finshots.in\"><u>bee crises</u></a>. Mass bee disappearance in Orissa, Punjab, Maharashtra and Kerala have been linked to excessive pesticide use and the push for non-native bee species.</p><p>Sure, there’s hope as localised beekeeping, rooftop hives and indigenous bee initiatives are taking root.</p><p>But the bottom line is that bees are going. And that’s nature telling us something. These tiny creatures are nature’s early warning system. And when they’re distressed, it means the planet is too. Strangely fascinating, but unsettling too, yeah?</p><p>So the next time you see one buzzing by, maybe don’t shoo it away. Bee kind. It’s doing a lot more for your diet than you think.</p><p><strong>Infographic 📊</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"2700\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/04/Migration-index-infog-2.png\" width=\"2160\"/></figure><p><strong>This Day in Financial History 📜</strong></p><p><em>10th of April, 1912 — The Titanic sets sail. But so do insurance payouts that shook the maritime world.</em></p><p>On this day, the RMS <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/office-of-general-counsel/gc-international-section/rms-titanic-history-and-significance?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Titanic%2C%20launched%20on%20May%2031,than%201%2C500%20passengers%20and%20crew.\"><u>Titanic left Southampton</u></a>, England, on its maiden voyage to New York City with 2,200 passengers onboard. It was supposed to be unsinkable and a floating marvel. Massive, luxurious and powered by cutting-edge marine engineering. But just four days later, the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic, claiming over 1,500 lives.</p><p>Now, you probably know this story. Maybe even watched it unfold with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio on screen.</p><p>But here’s a version you probably haven’t: the financial one.</p><p>The Titanic was <a href=\"https://blog.pia.org/2021/04/15/did-the-owners-of-the-rms-titanic-commit-insurance-fraud/?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Second%2C%20Titanic's%20construction%20number%20was,insured%20for%20only%20$5%20million.\"><u>insured</u></a> for <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2442450/5m-insurance-policy-document-Titanic-revealed-auctioneers.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$5 million</u></a>. And that was a staggering amount back then. The coverage came from a syndicate of insurers and was led by the renowned insurer Lloyd’s of London.</p><p>And when disaster struck, the claims rolled in fast. Life and accident insurance claims alone crossed <a href=\"https://meliorwealth.com/2020/10/21/titanic-disaster-led-to-historic-life-insurance-payouts/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$3.4 million</u></a>. Some of them made headlines. The family of railroad executive John B. Thayer received over $170,000, and another passenger, Herbert Chaffee, held the largest individual policy of $146,750. So adjusted for inflation, we’re talking millions today. And all of it collectively made Titanic not just one of the deadliest disasters, but one of the costliest in insurance history.</p><p>And just like that, the business of risk changed.</p><p>Insurers rewrote the rules. They raised premiums for transatlantic voyages, tightened underwriting standards and turned to reinsurance (basically, insurance for insurers) to spread risk. Marine actuarial science, the business of calculating the odds of sinking, suddenly got a lot more serious.</p><p>And the episode also reshaped global regulations. Because within two years, <a href=\"https://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety-of-Life-at-Sea-(SOLAS),-1974.aspx?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=The%20SOLAS%20Convention%20in%20its,and%20the%20fourth%20in%201960.\"><u>in 1914</u></a>, countries created the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which set new rules for lifeboats, emergency drills and continuous radio communication. In short, governments began treating safety as a financial priority and not just a moral one.</p><p>So yes, the Titanic sank. But what rose in its place was a new era of risk management that still anchors the insurance and shipping industries today.</p><p>Oh, and if you want to know how some folks turned the Titanic tragedy into a money making scheme, you can check out <a href=\"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/view/titanic-wreckage-has-been-a-business-gold-mine-for-100-years?ref=finshots.in\"><u>this piece</u></a> by NDTV.</p><p><strong>Readers Recommend 🗒️</strong></p><p>This week, our friend Anuradha Rao is back with another book recommendation ― <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180995.Plato_and_a_Platypus_Walk_Into_a_Bar?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar</u></a>, by Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein.</p><p>Interestingly, it’s a book that explains several philosophical concepts with jokes.</p><p>Thanks for the rec, Anuradha!</p><p>That’s it from us this week.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\"><strong>The Story</strong></h3><p>If we got a rupee for every time we heard the word <em>tariff</em> this past month, we’d be sitting on a small fortune by now. Because Donald Trump has made tariffs the centrepiece of his economic strategy. Again.</p><p>But the thing about tariffs is that they aren’t a new invention. In fact, they’re one of the oldest tricks you can find in economic textbooks.</p><p>Back in the day, the US didn’t run on income tax. It ran on tariffs. Foreign goods were taxed at the port, and that money helped build the country. Tariffs also protected fledgling industries from cheaper imports. And it worked. American manufacturing boomed under that protective umbrella.</p><p>But things took a turn in 1930 when the US passed the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act</u></a>. Tariffs jumped by 20%. Other countries hit back with their own tariffs. Global trade shrank. And while the tariffs didn’t single handedly cause the Great Depression, they certainly poured fuel on the fire.</p><p>So after World War II, that ended in 1945, the US flipped the script. It slashed tariffs and became the poster child for free trade. Income tax replaced tariffs as the primary source of government revenue. Global supply chains were born. Goods became cheaper. And everyone from companies to consumers benefitted.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"419\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeUhnwAl4BqsL0VsKswnqE-HHtKKBuDBOnrHKudIjArLUHpTkY2dUaxJHfS8oxWs-9ha71L9ZWHFg_yJfzwsIuq50NWq3et4Xe2rfHFbRuUq_hXUp4Imj23U_cwrVg8qcFlPMUcxQ?key=FFAooX1nrOzEPd8muXCd0fxw\" width=\"710\"/><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/even-now-tariffs-are-tiny-portion-us-government-revenue?ref=finshots.in\"><u><span class=\"underline\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">PIIE</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>So you could say that the US was built on tariffs. They funded the government without burdening citizens and protected local industry during its vulnerable early stages.</p><p>But that was then and we live in a different world now.</p><p>And before we dive into today’s drama, let’s quickly understand how tariffs actually work.</p><p>Let’s say you own a bakery in India. You and your fellow bakers have agreed to sell cupcakes for ₹30. Life’s good. Then someone starts importing fancier cupcakes from France and sells them for ₹25. Customers flock to the cheaper option and your business tanks. So to protect Indian businesses, the government steps in and slaps a ₹10 tariff on each French cupcake. Now they cost ₹35. And just like that, your ₹30 cupcake is back in the game. That extra ₹10? That’s a tariff — a tax on imports to protect local jobs, fund the government, or pressure trade partners.</p><p>Which brings us to the modern era of tariffs.</p><p>Now if you haven’t been tracking the recent tariff developments, here’s a TL;DR version. On April 2nd, Trump announced a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>10% blanket tariff</u></a>, with 34% additional tariffs on Chinese goods and 20% on some EU imports. China hit back with 84%, and Trump retaliated by hiking Chinese duties to a jaw-dropping 125%. And recently, while Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries (with a baseline 10% still in place), China was left out.</p><p>But Trump’s no stranger to this game. Between 2017 and 2021, his first term saw tariffs on everything from washing machines to solar panels. And at the time, critics called it reckless and inflationary. But surprisingly, prices stabilised and some domestic industries saw a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/tariffs-work-and-president-trumps-first-term-proves-it/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>bump</u></a>.</p><p>So now Trump wants to scale that experiment. And both his supporters and critics have a point.</p><p>Supporters argue tariffs bring in money. In 2019, US customs revenue from tariffs was <a href=\"https://www.fb.org/market-intel/tariff-revenues-up-sharply?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$72 billion</u></a>. A 10% blanket tariff on all imports (which totalled <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/over-a-sixth-of-global-trade-in-jeopardy-as-us-opens-a-front-against-all-nations-mc-analysis-12983110.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$3.8 trillion</u></a> in 2023) could generate hundreds of billions. Trump even floated <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/why-donald-trump-likes-tariffs-us-president-presidential-election-2024-india-america/\"><u>replacing income taxes</u></a> with tariffs. Plus, higher import costs could push companies to manufacture locally in the US, protecting jobs.</p><p>But the free trade crowd isn’t convinced. They say tariffs are just taxes on consumers. Importers pass on the higher costs to buyers. And retaliation is real. During Trump’s first term, China hit back with tariffs on US soybeans, and American farmers bled. Also, gains in one sector can cause pain in another. Steel tariffs might help US steelmakers, but carmakers relying on cheap imported steel could cut production and jobs.</p><p>And the problems don’t end there. We live in a hyper interconnected world today. A single car uses nearly <a href=\"https://motorway.co.uk/sell-my-car/guides/what-are-the-parts-of-a-car?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20car%20parts,complexity%20involved%20in%20car%20design.\"><u>30,000 parts</u></a>, and rebuilding all that domestically? Slow, expensive, and inefficient. And it could choke economic efficiency. Not to mention, tariffs could hurt the US globally. As countries begin to look elsewhere, the dollar could weaken and trade ties may erode.</p><p>And all of that makes you ask, why is Trump pushing them strongly?</p><p>Well, a few reasons.</p><p>One, it’s political. “We’re taxing foreign goods, bringing jobs home” makes a great pitch. Two, it’s strategic. Reciprocal tariffs aim to level the playing field. Meaning, if a country charges a 20% duty on American goods, the US will match that. So it’s about leverage. And then it’s also about the big picture. Trump’s camp believes open US markets have been exploited by countries like China, who use subsidies, currency tricks and lax labour laws.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Tariffs aren’t a magic fix. Even if they work, nobody knows how they pan out in today’s increasingly globalised world. Economists have debated them for over a century.</p><p>Take right now, for instance. The US economy is sitting on a mountain of debt and it paid <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/interest-expense-avg-interest-rates/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$583 billion</u></a> just in interest so far this year. That’s a system running on borrowed money. Now imagine tariffs triggering a full blown trade war. Tensions rise, uncertainty creeps in, and suddenly markets get jittery. And in a highly leveraged system like this, even a small shock can spiral. Tariffs might look like a long term fix, but in the short run, they could easily tip a debt laden economy into a recession.</p><p>Maybe that’s why Trump’s easing up. At least for now.</p><p>After all, this trade war involves two biggest economies in the world and over $500 billion in US-China trade.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"439\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdiwMY2mIIeCW1bp01KjcUivuUMcSIjciWdbw_iVtFac7tdmW1Fy02VOq0OjQxEN9dlKLRx4JCzrlEMtZ5W_V2OYmOpclW3pXWGBghg7wkO8qu-udh_PFL-4PnOacEyH2BLTR1qbA?key=FFAooX1nrOzEPd8muXCd0fxw\" width=\"742\"/><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html?ref=finshots.in#2024\"><u><span class=\"underline\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">United States Census Bureau</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>It might seem to you that the US has an upper hand because China relies more on US exports, and it’s the world’s factory. But also note that the US runs a $295 billion trade deficit with China. This leaves China with <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/the-us-wants-its-stock-market-to-crash/\"><u>excess dollars</u></a>, which it then recycles into US Treasury bonds. If it sells them in retaliation, it could rattle US markets. Things are fragile.</p><p>And where does India fit in?</p><p>Well, India hasn’t picked sides. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal says India has <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/indias-applied-tariffs-to-us-only-7-8-not-humongous-piyush-goyal-3482642?ref=finshots.in\"><u>no plans to retaliate</u></a>, and that its own tariffs aren’t “humongous”. The focus instead is on negotiation — a bilateral deal with the US and other trade agreements with biggies like <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/trump-tariff-india-uk-trade-ties-nirmala-sitharaman-b2730095.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>the UK</u></a> and Europe.</p><p>Meanwhile, China is calling for solidarity, urging India to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-stand-together-china-invites-india-to-fight-against-us-tariff-abuse/articleshow/120100639.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>oppose</u></a> what it calls US tariff “abuse”.</p><p>Yet, there’s silence from India and maybe that’s likely by design.</p><p>Because here’s the thing. This trade war might be an opportunity. If US companies want to diversify out of China but still need reliable, cost effective manufacturing partners, India might stand to gain. It doesn’t have to pick a side to benefit just yet. It just has to be ready. With the ability to plug into global value chains that are looking to recalibrate. But that window won’t stay open forever.</p><p>For now, global trade is realigning.

Despite the broader apparel retail sector going through a bit of a slump, Trent was defying the odds. Its expansion plans looked unstoppable and its stock was flying high.</p><p>And although the stock kept climbing after that, hitting an all-time high of around ₹8,345 per share sometime last year, the rally didn’t last. Over the past six months, it’s shed nearly a third of its value. And again just this Monday, it took another massive 15% nosedive. That’s <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/trent-shares-nosedive-over-19-after-analysts-cut-target-price-following-q4-miss-sharpest-fall-since-march-2020/articleshow/120054470.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>one of its worst</u></a> single-day crashes since the COVID chaos of March 2020.</p><p>So, what’s going on?</p><p>Let’s start with the heart of the matter — Trent’s operating profit, or more precisely, its EBITDA margins. Now, if you’re familiar with the company, you’d know that most of its revenue comes from two key brands: Zudio and Westside. And in the last quarter of FY25, both these brands have been growing aggressively. Especially Zudio, which went on an expansion spree, opening <a href=\"https://docs.trent-tata.com/Update_Q4_and_FY_2025.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>132 new stores</u></a> and taking the total count to 765. That’s a staggering 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57% in store additions!</p><p>But such rapid growth doesn’t come cheap. More stores mean higher operational costs. There’s staff salaries, rentals, supply chain, the whole shebang. And that has likely put pressure on Trent’s operating profits this year.</p><p>But rising costs aren’t the only reason margins are under strain. There’s also been a subtle but important shift in Trent’s revenue mix. Last year, Zudio contributed about 57% to the company’s revenue, while Westside made up 43%. This year, the script has flipped. Zudio’s share has dipped to <a href=\"https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/trent-limited/?ref=finshots.in#operationalmetrics\"><u>49%</u></a>, while Westside now makes up 50%.</p><p>On paper, that might not seem like a big deal. After all, Westside has higher operating margins, right? But Zudio was the real money spinner in terms of volume. Its low cost, fast fashion appeal, sub ₹500 average selling prices and quicker inventory replenishments made it the poster child of Trent’s growth story. So, a decline in Zudio’s share raises eyebrows.</p><p>And that dip likely came down to two key factors.</p><p>First, <a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/rs-47000-crore-loss-trents-fall-from-grace-six-key-reasons-behind-niftys-former-star-losing-shine-article-117512172?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Kotak Institutional Equities</u></a> pointed out a potential issue: store cannibalisation. Zudio’s breakneck expansion led to overlapping locations. Basically, stores opening up in the same pin codes. That means they ended up eating into each other’s sales, keeping revenue growth flat even though new stores were mushrooming.</p><p>Second, Westside has been making quiet gains in the digital space. <a href=\"https://www.sharekhan.com/MediaGalary/StockIdea/Trent-Feb07_2025.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Online sales</u></a> through westside.com and the Tata Neu platform grew by 45% year on year in the first nine months of FY25. Online now makes up over 6% of Westside’s total revenue. So while Zudio’s physical store expansion hit a ceiling, Westside was quietly capturing more ground online.</p><p>Then there’s rising competition. Just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/shein-india-entry-hurts-trent-shares-amid-fast-fashion-contest?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Shein</u></a> made its comeback in India through Reliance after a five year break. And it isn’t stopping there. Reliance also has big plans for Yousta, its affordable fashion brand, with a bold target of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnNvY1GRslo&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>1,000+ stores</u></a>. Sure, Yousta had only about 55 stores as of October 2024, but the intent is clear. The fast fashion game is heating up, and investors are watching closely.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest trigger for Trent’s stock crash was the Q4FY25 financial update that dropped last weekend. Investors weren’t thrilled. And when they’re disappointed, they don’t hold back.</p><p>To put things in perspective, Trent’s revenue for Q4 grew by 28% quarter on quarter to ₹4,300 crores. And for the full year, revenue jumped by 39% to ₹17,600 crores compared to FY24. But wait… That’s a good thing right?</p><p>Maybe. But if you’ve been a long observer or investor in Trent you might not feel the same.</p><p>That’s because this is a company that’s been setting the bar high for years. In Q4FY24, revenue had jumped 53% over the previous quarter. And over the past five years, quarterly revenue had been compounding at a whopping 43%. Compare that to this quarter’s 28% and the growth feels underwhelming. Even the 39% annual growth pales a bit when stacked up against FY24’s 54% jump over FY23.</p><p>So the problem isn’t the results. It’s the expectations. Investors had gotten used to a certain rhythm — quarter on quarter revenue growth of <a href=\"https://docs.trent-tata.com/TrentLimited/Financial%20Results/2023-24/Q4/Press%20Release%20Q4%20FY%202024.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>45%</u></a> and EBITDA margins shooting up at a CAGR of 162% until FY24. And when this year’s numbers didn’t keep up that pace, the mood soured.</p><p>And why did this happen, you ask?</p><p>You could blame the high base effect. Put simply, even though Trent added ₹4,955 crores in revenue this year, more than the ₹4,456 crores it added the year before, the percentage growth looks smaller because it’s now growing off a much bigger base. Think of it this way. If Trent earned ₹100 crores one year and ₹200 crores the next, that’s a 100% jump. But if it earns ₹350 crores the year after, that’s still a ₹150 crore increase. But percentage wise, it’s just 75%. So even if the company is growing more in absolute terms, it can mislead investors into thinking that the growth isn’t good enough.</p><p>Add to that the fact that the broader markets aren’t exactly in a cheerful mood either, thanks to global jitters sparked by Trump’s tariffs kicking in, and Trent has become a casualty in the process too.</p><p>But let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Trent’s fundamentals are still strong. It’s just that investor expectations shot through the roof. And when reality didn’t keep pace, the stock took a beating.</p><p>So yeah, maybe it’s worth looking at Trent with a bit more optimism.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+what%27s+behind+the+recent+nosedive+in+Trent%E2%80%99s+stock.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fsced8n&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F33g75x&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fsblps3&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+what%27s+behind+the+recent+nosedive+in+Trent%E2%80%99s+stock.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

Buffett quietly began preparing in 2024, when market optimism was at its peak.</p><p>Let us explain…</p><p>Buffett, with all his folksy charm, just went back to his classic playbook. And it’s one that’s as much about what not to do, as it is about bold bets.</p><p>While everyone was cheering on the bull run, Berkshire <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/markets-bleed-billionaires-lose-wealth-but-warren-buffett-emerges-richer-8106645?ref=finshots.in\"><u>sold $134 billion</u></a> worth of equities. And what did Buffett do with all that money? Nothing. He didn’t jump into private equity, buybacks, crypto, or chase the next AI boom. He parked that money in good ol’ US Treasury bills. Yes, boring but safe, predictable T-bills (something like short term government bonds in India).</p><p>Today, Berkshire sits on $330 billion in cash.

About half of it was added in 2024 (cash plus investments in Treasury bills in the image below), and over 85% of it is in short-term Treasuries earning about 5% a year.

He doesn’t care about hype. If something looks expensive, he’d rather wait than overpay. Or as he likes to say, “<em>It’s better to buy a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price.</em>” So when markets were soaring, Buffett either saw a correction coming or simply didn’t see better opportunities than T-bills.</p><p>And in 2024 he said it clearly. Stock valuations were just too high. His favourite market metric, the so-called “Buffett Indicator” (which compares the size of the stock market to the country’s GDP), had crossed 200% late last year. And that’s a level he once described as “playing with fire.” So he didn’t.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXckqkeWHg0ZrZC2EzIo70he2cIAv_Dyv2OAGsD8U28bHb0Q6ncVdr3COy1zywPvpur9IxvE0pWYGshcJFdvLKuU197lSrFgbF_swV0GPpUM96W6K3VHf-kdSx2rf8rDVsK-zyDL6g?key=BkuHgmOIKckBzcTyl9bJxJiP\" width=\"1200\"/><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/?ref=finshots.in\"><u><span class=\"underline\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Longtermtrends</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>And while the <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/is-the-buffett-indicator-foolproof/#:~:text=The%20Buffett%20Indicator%20is%20the,and%20services%20the%20country%20produces.\"><u>Buffett Indicator might not be foolproof</u></a>, other signals like the S&amp;P 500’s price to book ratio screamed overvaluation.

And while others danced on the fire, Buffett walked away with a hose in hand.</p><p>Then we have macro chaos.</p><p>With Trump back and tariffs looming, Buffett likely didn’t want to get caught in another economic war. He’s even gone so far as to say that tariffs are a kind of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2025/04/03/warren-buffett-a-tariff-is-an-act-of-war--smart-money-is-reacting/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>economic warfare</u></a>. And when the world looks uncertain, Buffett’s first rule is simple: Don’t lose money.</p><p>But there’s also something else that might have made him amass such cash. Buffett is 94. And the succession plan at Berkshire is already in place. Greg Abel, his chosen successor, will soon take over. So that cash pile is not just a defensive play, it’s a baton. A war chest ready for the successor to deploy when the time is right.</p><p>Because the truth is, Berkshire hasn’t found big acquisition targets in recent years since everything’s just been too expensive.</p><p>This moment isn’t his first rodeo either. It’s classic Buffett-style investing.</p><p>Back in 1999, when dot-com mania was peaking, Buffett sat it out. Tech stocks were flying and Berkshire looked old school. And then the bubble burst. Buffett survived and scooped up bargains while others nursed losses. Again in 2008, he went on the offensive. He bailed out Goldman Sachs and General Electric through stock deals that earned him billions. Even during COVID in 2020, when things crashed briefly, he stayed cautious — not because he didn’t have the money, but because the opportunity was too narrow.</p><p>And that discipline, paired with Charlie Munger’s clarity and Berkshire’s long-term bets, has helped Berkshire deliver a whopping 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from 1965 to 2024. The S&amp;P 500’s 10% CAGR during the same period falls flat in comparison. For perspective, ₹100 invested with Buffett in 1965 would be over ₹46 lakhs today. But in the S&amp;P 500? Just about ₹27,000!</p><p>Which brings us to today.</p><p>The markets are panicking but Buffett isn’t losing sleep. Because if prices fall further, he’s ready to buy. If they don’t, he’s happy collecting billions in interest.</p><p>And that, folks, is the beauty of having cash. It doesn’t just protect you, it gives you freedom to wait, to act, to ignore the noise and do what makes sense.</p><p>Sure, Buffett has more information, more tools and a massive team. But this isn’t about having an edge. It’s about patience. About looking for the right price and holding your nerve when everyone else is losing theirs.</p><p>So the lesson is simple: You don’t need a billion dollar portfolio to think like Buffett. You just need a little restraint. A little awareness of value. And a little dry powder when things go on sale.</p><p>Because when others are fearful, Buffett gets greedy. And now that fear is back, he’s probably getting ready to pounce again (He’s already seeing value in Japanese companies and investing there, for instance).</p><p>If that’s where you are too, pat yourself on the back and good luck building your portfolio!</p><p>And if not, now’s as good a time as any to remember what Buffett taught us. It’s better to pay ₹80 for something worth ₹100, than ₹100 for something that might be worth ₹150 someday. That’s true in stocks, in real estate or even for mangoes at your local sabzi mandi.</p><p>And cash? Cash lets you make bold moves when fear takes over the markets. Because that’s when Buffett acts. And maybe, that’s what you should prepare for too.</p><p>So tell us. How’s the market bloodbath feeling to you, and are you taking any notes from Buffett?</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+how+Warren+Buffett%E2%80%99s+seeing+his+portfolio+grow+when+most+top+billionaires+bleed+losses.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fjnzo0m&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F7n5kuk&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fhpzf6r&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+how+Warren+Buffett%E2%80%99s+seeing+his+portfolio+grow+when+most+top+billionaires+bleed+losses.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>What if you never had to open an app again?</p><p>Imagine that you’re planning a trip. From the moment you step out of your house to boarding a flight or train, from booking your hotel stay to reserving a cab at your destination, every little detail is sorted. But here’s the twist. You don’t need to open a single app. No hopping between Expedia, Skyscanner or MakeMyTrip. No switching tabs, no downloading, no juggling five different interfaces. Instead, you’re just chatting with an AI agent, and it’s doing all the heavy lifting for you.</p><p>Sounds crazy, we know. But that’s where we’re heading.</p><p>So, what exactly is an <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents?ref=finshots.in\"><u>AI agent</u></a>?</p><p>Think of them as super smart digital assistants. You give them a task, and they figure out how to get it done. Whether it’s pulling information from other apps, making decisions on the fly or even learning something new on the job, these agents are built to operate independently. They don’t need to be spoon fed instructions at every step. And they don’t forget what they’ve done before either.</p><p>Let’s say a company used to need six people working round the clock to plan and execute its marketing campaigns. With an AI agent though, one person and the agent can wrap it all up in under an hour. Sure, that sounds like bad news for jobs, but there’s a bright side too. These AI agents could be a game changer in sectors facing severe talent shortages.</p><p>Take cybersecurity, for instance. In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/22/the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-the-third-wave-of-ai/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>over 5.5 million</u></a> positions were lying vacant in the field globally. That leaves companies vulnerable. Without enough employees in the field, it’s tough to detect and respond to threats in real time. And it’s only getting worse. Research from the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/12/ai-agents-risks-artificial-intelligence/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>World Economic Forum</u></a> shows that since 2024, the cyber security skills gap has widened by another 8%. Two out of every three organisations say that they just don’t have the talent they need to stay secure. This is where AI agents can step in. They can detect suspicious logins, block intruders accessing a system from odd locations or flag traffic spikes when hackers try to flood a website with fake visits. And they can act pretty quickly.</p><p>But that’s just in the corporate world. On the personal front, AI agents are just as handy. Whether you need to reset a password, analyse a complex spreadsheet, generate an image or just search the internet, they’ve got your back. And since they know how to tap into other systems to fetch what they need, you don’t have to juggle ten different apps just to get one job done.</p><p>Amazon’s already testing this idea with an AI shopping agent feature called “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/amazons-new-ai-agent-will-shop-third-party-stores-for-you/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Buy for Me</u></a>”. So if Amazon doesn’t have a product you’re looking for, this AI agent will find it on other websites. And if you like what it shows, it’ll place the order, all without you ever leaving the Amazon app. That’s great for Amazon. Not so much for everyone else. Because if people stop hopping between apps and stick to the one where an AI agent gets everything done, other platforms could start losing serious ground.</p><p>And that’s a problem. See, apps thrive on user traffic. More users mean more sales, more in-app purchases, more data to learn from and more advertising revenue. Apps make services easier to access. If you want to use Adobe’s design tools, the app streamlines your experience. But if users no longer feel the need to open that app, it loses business.</p><p>Now, we’re not making this point just because of one new AI agent that Amazon is working on. AI agents aren’t exactly new and have been on the rise for a while now. For context, the global market for AI agents is projected to grow from <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/22/the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-the-third-wave-of-ai/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$5 billion</u></a> in 2024 to a whopping $47 billion by 2030. That’s a compounded annual growth rate of 45%!</p><p>While much of this growth is on the business side, there isn’t much chatter about how they’re reshaping consumer habits. But if we were to take cues from generative AI, it’s clear that consumer focused AI agents might catch on pretty quickly. To put things in perspective, Gartner predicts a <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents?ref=finshots.in\"><u>25% drop</u></a> in search engine traffic by 2026, thanks to the rise of generative AI and personal AI agents. If that’s anything to go by, it’s entirely possible that you’ll be ditching apps and turning to an AI agent to get things done sooner than you think.</p><p>So… is this the end of apps?</p><p>You’d think so, right? Especially when you hear about AI agents like Midjourney helping you design stunning graphics just by chatting with it — no need to learn Adobe or Canva. Or Mindtrip, an AI travel planner that could replace your usual go to platforms like Expedia or TripAdvisor. In fact, even biggies like <a href=\"https://www.outlookbusiness.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-reveals-how-ai-agents-will-disrupt-saas-models?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20tech%20giant,India's%20AI%20and%20cloud%20ecosystem.\"><u>Satya Nadella</u></a> and Nandan Nilekani see AI agents replacing apps in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"2095\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/04/Felicis.png\" width=\"3600\"/><figcaption><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </em></i><a href=\"https://www.felicis.com/insight/the-agent-economy?ref=finshots.in\"><u><i><em class=\"italic underline\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Felicis</em></i></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>But here’s the thing. History is proof that technology doesn’t always wipe out what came before. As <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/the-great-debate-will-agentic-ai-kill-saas/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Chuck Whitten</u></a>, Senior Partner at Bain &amp; Company puts it beautifully, “One lesson history teaches us is that technological revolutions are rarely binary. Transitions don’t typically lead to total replacement. Instead, they create ecosystems marked by heterogeneity—a mix of old and new models, each finding its niche.”</p><p>Just look at the PC. When smartphones and tablets exploded in popularity, many predicted the death of the personal computer. But this story you’re reading was actually written on a laptop. PCs didn’t disappear. They just found a new purpose. They’re still the go-to when you need to get serious work done. They’re built for focus, multitasking and heavy duty tasks that your phone just isn’t cut out for.</p><p>Or take <a href=\"https://appmarketplace.com/blog/ai-agents-replace-augment-apps?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Slack</u></a>. It promised to revolutionise workplace communication. And people thought email would fade into obscurity. But guess what? Email usage has only gone up globally from 280 billion emails sent and received daily in 2018 to 360 billion in 2024 (nearly a 30% increase). That number’s expected to hit 400 billion by 2027. Why? Because old habits die hard. Email still feels more formal, more “official”, especially in business. And once something becomes a norm, it’s tough to change it.</p><p>That’s perhaps how AI agents will coexist with apps too. Rather than killing them, they might nudge apps to evolve. We could see more apps building their own AI agent style features to keep users within their ecosystems. After all, third-party AI agents still need data and most of that data sits within the apps that have been around for years. If these apps invest in smarter AI interfaces of their own, they might offer better, more integrated experiences than any outside agent can.</p><p>And here’s another thing. While one AI agent might help you plan a trip, it won’t help you create a poster or file your taxes. You’d still need multiple AI agents for different tasks. In a way, that’s no different from using different apps today. Sure, the interface might change from swiping and tapping to simply chatting. But the fragmentation remains. Unless a single, all-powerful agent comes along that can do it all, convenience will still come with trade offs.</p><p>Which is why this whole AI agent wave might help apps. Sure, they might feel the pressure to invest, innovate and offer better experiences to stay relevant. But that’s a good thing, right?</p><p>Until next time...</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A+story+that+dives+into+whether+AI+agents+could+replace+apps.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fh09x3j&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fb3w04g&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F4iv1od&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=A+story+that+dives+into+whether+AI+agents+could+replace+apps.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>Last week, at the Startup Mahakumbh, India’s Commerce Minister <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weve-food-apps-china-has-ai-ev-goyals-startup-reality-check/articleshow/119958306.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Piyush Goyal</u></a> ruffled a few feathers when he questioned the country’s startup ecosystem. He was particularly dismayed that too many founders are busy building things like fancy ice cream brands, 10-minute grocery apps or fantasy sports platforms. He did acknowledge that many of these startups have done well in terms of funding, user acquisition, job creation and even revenue and profitability. But in Goyal’s view, these consumer businesses were not exactly pushing the boundaries of innovation.</p><p>He even drew a contrast with China, where several new-age companies had successfully forayed into deep tech sectors like semiconductors, robotics, AI, 3D manufacturing and machine learning.</p><p><em>Sidebar: Deep tech refers to innovations founded on scientific or engineering advancements, often aiming to create a significant impact for society and, thereby, the economy.</em></p><p>Getting back, Goyal wants Indians to not just focus on tech for convenience, but tech that solves complex problems and creates a long-term global economy through cutting-edge industries. So yeah, he believes that for India to become a true global tech powerhouse, its startups need to think bigger and deeper and ditch that low-hanging fruit.</p><p>So well, we thought, let’s analyse why he said so, and if the Indian startup ecosystem is truly lagging when it comes to new age technology and innovation.</p><p>See, over the past decade, China has quietly built a startup ecosystem that chases breakthroughs.</p><p>Take AI, for instance. Chinese startup <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/deepseek-the-model-that-broke-the-market/\"><u>DeepSeek</u></a> recently grabbed global attention with an open-source AI model that’s reportedly on par with ChatGPT’s GPT-4. Then there’s <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/09/tech/hikvision-sensetime-blacklist/index.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>SenseTime, Megvii and Yitu</u></a>, AI unicorns powering everything from facial recognition at airports to surveillance. And mind you, these aren’t pet projects. These are deeply integrated into real-life use cases.</p><p>In semiconductors, despite intense US sanctions, China hasn’t slowed down. Startups like Biren Technology and Moore Threads are working on GPUs and AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nanhiein/2016/06/17/chinese-startup-horizon-robotics-is-building-chips-to-power-a-i/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Horizon Robotics</u></a> is building AI chips specifically for self-driving vehicles. And Chinese firms reportedly spent over billions buying Nvidia’s advanced chips not just to use but to learn and build.</p><p>Even in 3D manufacturing, companies like XtalPi, founded by Chinese MIT grads, are fusing quantum physics and AI to reduce the timeline for <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3295312/ai-driven-drug-discovery-aided-greater-bay-area-integration-hong-kong-listed-firm-says?ref=finshots.in\"><u>drug development</u></a> from 4 years to just 2.</p><p>In EVs and battery tech, Chinese companies aren’t just churning out electric cars. They’re building software-first, autonomous-ready vehicles. Behind the scenes, battery innovators are thriving, thanks to support from giants like CATL and BYD. Numerous countries in the world import electric cars and even EV batteries from China.</p><p>On the consumer side, Chinese startups have reimagined entire categories. WeChat became the blueprint for super apps. And TikTok rewrote how the world discovers content, with its algorithm-first design now copied globally. You might or might not remember Tiktok trolling Instagram when it launched ubiquitous ‘Reels’ in 2020: “Well... this looks familiar”.</p><p>So, if you look at China, it’s hard to argue with Goyal’s point.</p><p>But how did they manage to achieve so much, you might wonder?</p><p>Well, it wasn’t overnight. Of course, with government support.</p><p>In 2015, the government picked key industries through its ‘Made in China 2025’ and then flooded these tech-startups with the support they needed. Its ‘14th Five-Year Plan’ starting in 2021, focused on sustainable development and tech advancements.</p><p>We’re talking about massive funding via government-led venture capital arms, dedicated tech parks with subsidised office space and shared R&amp;D labs. And in many cases, the government itself acts as the first customer, buying deep tech products to kickstart adoption.</p><p>It wasn’t just support. It was state-led ecosystem building.</p><p>Take semiconductors. In 2014, China launched its National Integrated Circuit Plan, pledging <a href=\"https://www.semiconductors.org/taking-stock-of-chinas-semiconductor-industry/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>over $150 billion</u></a> to reduce dependence on foreign chipmakers. But it wasn’t just about funding big-ticket players. The state stitched together the entire stack — from chip design institutes and fabs to talent pools and tax breaks for firms that used local chips.</p><p>Or look at Zhongguancun, a suburb of Beijing that got a full makeover. With rent subsidies, patent support and easy access to public grants, it transformed into <a href=\"https://focus.cbbc.org/how-did-zhongguancun-become-chinas-silicon-valley/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>China’s Silicon Valley</u></a>, now home to the likes of Baidu, Xiaomi, Lenovo and a wave of AI and biotech startups.</p><p>Even in electric vehicles, China didn’t just subsidise carmakers. It built charging infrastructure, offered license plate perks to EV owners, handed out cashback for R&amp;D, and looped in battery majors like CATL and BYD, building a full-stack EV economy from scratch.</p><p>Also, the slashing of taxes and money spent by the Chinese government on R&amp;D is worth praising. For instance, in 2024 alone, China slashed <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/india-startups-vs-china-deep-tech-innovation-ai-evs-piyush-goyal-125040400979_1.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$361 billion</u></a> in taxes and fees for high-tech firms, including $80.7 billion in R&amp;D deductions. That same year, China’s total R&amp;D spending hit $496 billion, compared to India’s $23.45 billion (₹20,000 crores) allocation to kickstart a private sector-led R&amp;D fund under the FY25 Budget.</p><p>In fact, China’s 2024 tax revenues totalled a whopping <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-2024-fiscal-revenue-grows-13-down-64-year-earlier-2025-01-24/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>17.5 trillion yuan</u></a> (around ₹200 lakh crores). Just for context, that’s <a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/rec/ar.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>over 5 times</u></a> what India earned in tax revenues that year. Now imagine funding massive deep tech innovation with a revenue that’s a fraction of China’s. If India truly wants to play in this league, it either has to drastically overhaul its taxation system, something Indian taxpayers might not be ready for, or find a way to expand its tax base. And that’s where things get tricky.</p><p>You see, <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/why-do-only-5-of-indians-pay-income-tax/\"><u>barely 5%</u></a> of India’s population pays income tax. That’s a very small chunk carrying a very large burden. To increase this base, we need more jobs. But ironically, new tech is killing them. Akhil Gupta, former head of Blackstone India, recently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-far-is-india-from-creating-its-own-deepseek.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>told CNBC</u></a> that AI is displacing jobs in India’s tech sector. And with unemployment already high, more productivity tools could end up worsening the situation. So it’s a bit of a vicious circle. Technology improves productivity, but that productivity ends up displacing jobs. And unless we create more labour and manufacturing jobs to balance it out, this loop could keep tightening.</p><p>The talent gap is also just as wide. China had 2.2 million R&amp;D workers in 2022. That’s 2.5 times more than India’s.</p><p>And while we often talk about becoming self-reliant or “Atmanirbhar”, it’s easier said than done. For years, we’ve been comfortable using products built by US tech giants. Shifting from that comfort zone and building our own alternatives will take not just willpower but deep capability. And frankly, we aren’t quite there yet.</p><p>Take high-performance chips, for example — the kind used to train deep tech AI models. India doesn’t produce them. We rely on the US. And with recent export restrictions, even that reliance is now under pressure. The same story <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/the-great-india-china-conundrum-economic-survey/\"><u>repeats in other sectors</u></a>, such as electronic components and active ingredients for pharmaceuticals.  We source a lot of it from China. So yes, wanting to be Atmanirbhar is great in spirit, but practically, we’re still caught in a web of external dependencies. Another vicious cycle.</p><p>Sure, the Indian government has announced a dedicated Fund of Funds for deeptech startups and a ₹10,000 crore “<a href=\"https://the-ken.com/story/your-guide-to-indias-rs-10000-cr-ai-mission-thats-running-on-fomo/?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Incidentally%2C%20all%20this%20is%20adding,10%2C370%20crore%20(%241.2%20billion).\"><u>India AI Mission</u></a>”, which it will spend over the next five years to step up the country’s AI capabilities apart from the ₹20,000 crores we mentioned earlier.</p><p>But that alone cannot ensure that we will truly be able to follow China’s path.</p><p>For that, we need innovative minds to take risks, and the government must offer strong support for these ventures to flourish and, hopefully, create a global footprint.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A+story+where+we+explore+why+India%E2%80%99s+Commerce+Minister%2C+Piyush+Goyal%2C+is+nudging+Indian+startups+to+move+beyond+hyperfast+grocery+and+food+delivery+and+build+deep+tech+startups.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Ftyzt7w&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fho031j&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Ffgtrfc&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=A+story+where+we+explore+why+India%E2%80%99s+Commerce+Minister%2C+Piyush+Goyal%2C+is+nudging+Indian+startups+to+move+beyond+hyperfast+grocery+and+food+delivery+and+build+deep+tech+startups.&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

But that’s the world of <a href=\"https://thenodmag.com/content/clubs-are-dead-long-live-the-kitchen-rave?ref=finshots.in\"><u>coffee raves</u></a>. From Amsterdam and New York to Indian cities, this sober-friendly trend is bubbling up fast. And here’s how it works — DJs spinning sunrise sets in cafés, baristas pulling espresso shots instead of cocktails, and crowds dancing to good vibes, all before breakfast or during sunset.</p><p>Now, the idea isn’t entirely new to India. The model popped up briefly back in <a href=\"https://www.mid-day.com/sunday-mid-day/article/coffee-and-a-party-on-the-side-23458770?ref=finshots.in\"><u>2018</u></a>, probably thanks to expensive nightlife real estate and a rising curiosity around alternative party scenes. But it didn’t quite stick. Maybe the coffee culture hadn’t fully percolated yet, or partygoers weren’t quite ready to trade their tequila shots for caffeine highs. </p><p>Fast forward to now, and Gen Z’s craving for unique, Instagrammable, community-driven experiences has given it a second shot. Artists like DJ Tanishq are touring with More Coffee More Rave. And it’s doing a few good things. Cafés get more footfall. Artists get new gigs and a sober-friendly audience and even teenagers. And for the rest of us, it could be a dopamine hit without the hangover. Especially in dry states like Gujarat, it’s a workaround that comes with no red tape.</p><p>Sure, some say it’s just a fad. Not all cafés are built for acoustics, the novelty might wear off, and frequent parties might shoo away regulars who just want a quiet cup of joe.</p><p>But even if the format evolves, the appetite for fresh ways to “go out” is real. And India’s <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/can-india-fill-the-shoes-of-the-top-coffee-exporting-nations/\"><u>coffee market</u></a> is booming. Event culture is thriving.

No, seriously. Because your phone’s compass (and pretty much every GPS system out there) depends on Earth’s magnetic field. And that magnetic field is powered by our planet’s spinning metal core.</p><p>But the thing is that this magnetic field isn’t fixed. In fact, the <a href=\"https://indiandefencereview.com/earths-magnetic-north-pole-just-shifted-again-scientists-have-officially-updated-its-position/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>magnetic north pole</u></a> is drifting, and right now, it's sliding closer to Siberia.</p><p>You see, unlike the geographic North Pole, which stays put, magnetic north is a bit of a wanderer. Since it was first discovered in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/North-Magnetic-Pole?ref=finshots.in\"><u>1831</u></a> by British explorer James Clark Ross, it’s travelled thousands of kilometres. From Canada to Russia, and it’s been shifting faster in recent decades, drifting at around <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/21/science/magnetic-north-pole-new-position/index.html?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=British%20explorer%20Sir%20James%20Clark,75%20miles%20(120%20kilometers).\"><u>35 kilometres</u></a> a year!</p><p>And if that feels too technical, you can think of Earth’s core like a massive pot of molten soup. As it churns, it creates invisible magnetic lines around the planet. And these lines help everything from birds and whales to ships, planes and yes, your Uber driver, figure out which way the North is.</p><p>So if our maps don’t keep up with this magnetic drift, things can go haywire. A few degrees off, and suddenly a plane’s autopilot might think it's flying toward Delhi when it’s supposed to land in Dubai.  A ship might misnavigate a port. Even your food delivery guy might take a few wrong turns.</p><p>That’s why scientists constantly update something called the World Magnetic Model (<a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model?ref=finshots.in\"><u>WMM</u></a>). It’s like the GPS version of refreshing your Google Maps app but for the entire planet. That’s probably why it’s complicated and takes time, money, and a whole lot of data. Last year in December, they rolled out an update which will remain valid until late 2029. And the recent update comes with a super high-res version that’s more detailed, used in aviation, defence, and maritime industries. And over the next few years, companies will need to integrate this into their systems to stay on track.</p><p>But here's the wild part. Earth’s magnetic field has actually flipped in the past. Like a full-on reversal, where north becomes south and vice versa. The last one occurred around 780,000 years ago (known as the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal). The planet survived, of course. But humans weren’t around to see what happened to satellites, telecom networks, or marinelife.</p><p>Now, we’re not saying a flip is coming tomorrow. But shifts are happening. And while AI-assisted recalibration and self-adjusting magnetometers are being tested, the best fix available right now is regular WMM model updates. Which GPS and tech teams across the world are working on as we speak. Because the longer we wait, the bigger the error in direction.</p><p>So next time your cab driver gets you somewhere or your pilot lands smoothly through dense clouds — remember, it’s not just tech. It’s also molten iron magic happening deep below, keeping our modern world on track.</p><p>Crazy, yeah?</p><p><strong>Infographic 📊</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdNkBC7R_UCj5hkgNmveuLC4xKLT57626je2LiNP2NC39C5wnUnHBgao5lTHPa6p1Ww7sdcj8wPxZF-9tlrBKzlZOW2_aQVAa751AzPmJ429JRPrYsQrpPDFR26wFeQz-btHObN?key=CnVEy0KJ2emvMFxkxxlFwX3h\" width=\"512\"/></figure><p><strong>This Day in Financial History 📜</strong></p><p><em>1st of April, 1957 ― India’s coins transitioned to the decimal system</em></p><p>On this day, India decided to give its coinage system a makeover.</p><p>Because you see, before 1957, money in India was a bit of a maths puzzle. ₹1 wasn’t just 100 paise. It was split into 16 annas, and each anna into 4 pice. Not exactly easy to split a bill. This system was a colonial hangover and had been around for decades.</p><p>So in 1955, India decided to make things simpler. <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=26527&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>The Coinage Act</u></a> was amended. And two years later, the decimal system kicked in. The rupee stayed the same, just split into 100 paise. These new coins were called “naye paise” (new paise), just to help people tell them apart from the older ones.</p><p>Simple. Or so they thought.</p><p>But for a while, both old and new coins were in circulation, and people had to do conversions on the fly. A plate of idlis that earlier cost 4 annas (a quarter rupee) was now 25 naye paise. But many shopkeepers charged 26 paise instead.</p><p>If that made you go “why?”, well, it was partly because people were still wrapping their heads around the new system. Others rounded up out of habit or convenience. If something came to 25.25 paise, it was easier to round up to 26 paise. Some even used the confusion to their advantage, knowing most wouldn’t argue over a paisa.</p><p>But they were wrong. Arguments still broke out, especially in smaller towns where every paisa mattered. And that was understandable as one paisa could still get you peanuts or a front-row cinema seat back then!</p><p>So yeah, it took some time until people got used to the change. And it wasn’t until 1964 that the word “naya” was dropped. People had made peace with paise.</p><p>Over the next couple of decades, smaller coins like 1, 2 and 3 paise quietly disappeared as rising prices made them practically worthless.</p><p>Fun fact: The quarter anna, a copper coin about the size of today’s ₹1, had a hole in the middle. That design was practically meant for stringing 64 coins together into a ₹1 garland! But when the coin eventually fell out of use, plumbers and mechanics got creative and repurposed them as washers to fix nuts and bolts. Now that’s some real jugaad!</p><p>And that’s how India fully embraced its decimal journey.</p><p>P.S. If this intrigued you, we recommend reading this beautifully written article, “<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/the-forgotten-anniversary-of-decimalisation/articleshow/2659901.cms?from=mdr&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>The Forgotten Anniversary of Decimalisation</u></a>” by Vikram Doctor in The Economic Times.</p><p><strong>Readers Recommend 🗒️</strong></p><p>This week, our reader Aashish Nuhani has a book recommendation for us. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.in/book/coffee-can-investing/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Coffee Can Investing</u></a> by Saurabh Mukherjea, Rakshit Ranjan, Pranab Uniyal.</p><p>Aashish tells us that this book simplifies personal finance and goal-based investing.

An all-electric cab service backed by climate funds, VCs, and tons of goodwill. But things have gone south lately. Several top executives have resigned and its key financier, Gensol, defaulted on ₹470 crores in loans. </p><p>So, what gives?</p><p>Turns out, BluSmart’s close relationship with Gensol Engineering — the company that leased it thousands of EVs using government-backed loans — may have helped it scale fast, but also raised some red flags on governance.</p><p>And with Gensol now defaulting on loans and investors getting jittery, BluSmart faces an uphill climb to stay in the race. The bigger question though? Can it run on its own — or was it always just piggybacking on Gensol?</p><p>That’s something we answer in our <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/blusmart-is-knee-deep-in-trouble-gensol/\"><u>Monday’s newsletter</u></a>.</p><h3 id=\"risdiplam-the-cost-of-survival-is-pharma-playing-fair\"><strong>Risdiplam &amp; the cost of survival: Is pharma playing fair?</strong></h3><p>Imagine having a rare disease. Then imagine the cure exists—but it costs ₹70 lakhs a year. Ouch!</p><p>Well, that’s the story of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients and Roche’s life-saving drug, Risdiplam.</p><p>Indian pharma company Natco wants to sell a cheaper version. But Roche holds the patent till 2035. So they went to court, and for once, the court sided with affordability. It refused to block Natco’s generic version, pointing to Roche’s astronomical markups and questionable patent extensions.</p><p>But this whole thing has raised the age-old debate — should life-saving drugs come with life-crushing price tags?</p><p>So yeah, it’s more than a legal fight. It’s about ethics, monopolies, and India’s place as the world’s pharmacy.

Everyone, that is, except Warren Buffett. </p><p>The Oracle of Omaha still isn’t impressed. Because gold, unlike stocks or businesses, doesn’t earn or create anything. It just... exists. While the shiny metal may be riding on fears of global uncertainty, Buffett’s view is clear — gold doesn’t pay dividends, doesn’t innovate and isn’t productive. And yet, with returns outpacing stock markets recently, people can’t seem to resist the glitter. </p><p>But hey, just because it looks good on paper doesn’t mean it belongs in your portfolio or does it?

But it’s a big deal. It affects how much you pay for CNG, how much farmers pay for fertiliser, and how much the government has to subsidise.</p><p>Throw in a weak rupee, global gas volatility, and rising demand, and you’ve got a real challenge on your hands. And the dream of gas fueling India’s clean energy ambitions? It’s now a tightrope walk.

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of helium? Probably party balloons, right? The ones that float up into the sky. But once they burst, that helium leaks into the atmosphere, drifts up and eventually escapes into space. It’s gone. Forever.</p><p>And that’s what makes helium so unique – and problematic. To understand why, let’s take it from the top.</p><p>Helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the universe. But the catch is that it’s exceedingly rare on Earth. That’s because it’s an inert gas (so it doesn’t easily bond with other elements in chemical reactions) and incredibly light (so it floats away quickly). So when you combine those two traits, you’ve got a gas that’s nearly impossible to hold on to.</p><p>In fact, we didn’t even know helium existed on Earth until 1895. Scientists had only detected it in the Sun’s spectrum, which is why it’s named after Helios, the Greek god of the Sun. But when British chemist William Ramsay <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1247?ref=finshots.in\"><u>isolated it</u></a> from uranium ore, it became clear that this solar element was hiding on earth too, but just in very small quantities.</p><p>And for a while, nobody thought much of this discovery. But that changed during World War I when the US realised it could be used in <a href=\"https://builtin.com/articles/airships?ref=finshots.in\"><u>airships</u></a> as a safer alternative to hydrogen. For context, hydrogen is highly flammable – one small spark, and the entire airship could go up in flames. But with helium, it was a perfect eureka moment. And by the time World War II came about, helium had become a military essential, used in rocket propulsion and to cool nuclear reactors.</p><p>Still, helium was rare. So how did it become so widely available as we can see today, you ask?</p><p>Well, it all goes back to the US. At the start of the 20th century, drillers in the <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>US state of Kansas</u></a> hit a rich natural gas deposit. But the gas just wouldn’t ignite. That’s when the scientists analysed it and found out that the gas reserves contained an unusually high amount of helium. And that set off a new realisation: Helium wasn’t just in the skies or exotic minerals; it was hiding right under our feet, trapped in underground pockets mixed with natural gas. And from there, the US raced ahead. For nearly a century, it dominated global helium production, thanks to its Texas-based Helium Reserve – the world’s largest helium stockpile.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and you can see helium powering a surprising range of critical industries. Take healthcare, for instance. MRI machines rely on liquid helium to cool their superconducting magnets. Quantum computers need helium to reach temperatures close to absolute zero. Then there’s the semiconductor industry, where gas plays a crucial role in plasma etching, cooling, and purging contaminants. Even the space industry depends on it as rockets use helium to pressurise fuel tanks, and satellite instruments need it for cooling. It’s also a lifesaver for deep-sea divers, who use a mixture of 80% helium and 20% Oxygen to breathe under high-pressure conditions. And yeah, it’s at your supermarket checkouts, too: the helium-neon gas lasers in barcode scanners wouldn’t work without it.</p><p>So yeah, it’s everywhere. The only problem is that its reserves are limited and we’re running out of it!</p><p>Because for one, helium is non-renewable. Once extracted and used, it eventually escapes. And we can’t artificially produce it. Second, its supply is highly concentrated. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250331-why-helium-shortages-are-worrying-the-world?ref=finshots.in\"><u>US, Qatar, and Algeria</u></a> control most of it. But with US reserves depleting and geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains, there’s a serious bottleneck.</p><p>And demand is booming. Helium demand is expected to nearly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/helium-demand-double-by-2035-tracking-chip-production-boom-report-says-2024-09-09/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>double by 2035</u></a>, especially due to the semiconductor boom driven by AI and advanced computing. And since helium has no viable alternatives for heat management in semiconductor manufacturing, demand could skyrocket and so might the prices.</p><p>And this worry isn’t limited to high-tech industries. The helium shortage is now threatening something as basic as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/should-we-be-concerned-about-the-loss-of-weather-balloons/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>weather forecasting</u></a>. Weather balloons, which carry specialised sensors to collect vital data on temperature, wind, and humidity, rely on helium. But the US National Weather Service has started scaling back balloon launches due to the shortage. And that could reduce forecasting accuracy and lead to less warning ahead of severe weather events.</p><p>And in India, we rely entirely on imports for helium, making us exposed to price fluctuations and supply disruptions. So if the tap runs dry, industries like healthcare, electronics, space research and AI could face setbacks.</p><p>But there’s a glimmer of hope.</p><p>In 2016, massive helium reserves were discovered in Tanzania – an estimated <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/28/africa/helium-discovery-tanzania/index.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>54 billion cubic feet (bcf)</u></a>, enough to fill over a million medical MRI scanners. And later assessments suggest the real number could be much higher. Just last month, Tanzania granted its first-ever helium mining license to <a href=\"https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/tanzania-issues-first-ever-helium-mining-licence-to-helium-one-global-4950586?ref=finshots.in#story\"><u>Helium One Global</u></a>. If all goes well, production could start soon, offering the world a new supply lifeline.</p><p>In the meantime, countries are scrambling. Some are stockpiling helium in strategic reserves. Others are investing in helium recycling — especially for MRI machines and other medical uses. And researchers are testing alternative gases where possible.</p><p>But for now, the bottom line is that until new sources are online and recycling becomes widespread, we need to use helium like the precious resource it is. Because once it’s gone, it’s not coming back.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+why+the+world+is+running+out+of+helium+and+why+that%E2%80%99s+a+much+bigger+problem+than+it+sounds.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fe1mbhe&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F2gwfad&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fq783cp&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+why+the+world+is+running+out+of+helium+and+why+that%E2%80%99s+a+much+bigger+problem+than+it+sounds.&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>Every day before you start to get work done you rely on something essential without even realising it. It powered the cab you took to work, heated the water in your shower, lit the stove in your kitchen and even helped grow the vegetables on your plate.</p><p>We’re talking about natural gas.</p><p>And we’re talking about it because it’s about to get pricier. From this month (April 2025) the government has tweaked natural gas’ price calculation, marking the first hike in two years. To understand why, let’s take it from the top.</p><p>Look, natural gas is mostly methane (CH4). It burns cleaner than other fossil fuels and is incredibly versatile. It’s used in transportation, cooking gas, to power industries like ceramics and steel and making fertilisers essential to Indian agriculture. But despite this, it only accounts for <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/capital-market-news/india-to-increase-natural-gas-consumption-to-15-in-its-energy-mix-125021401116_1.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>6%</u></a> of India’s total energy consumption. And India wants to triple this share to 15% by 2030. But since we’re not there yet, we import <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/robust-recovery-in-demand-amid-cheaper-prices-bumps-up-indias-reliance-on-natural-gas-imports-9239040/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>about 50%</u></a> of our gas, mostly as liquefied natural gas (LNG). And that’s where things get tricky. Importing LNG means we’re constantly at the mercy of global price shocks.</p><p>Take 2020, for example. ONGC, India’s biggest gas producer back then, was selling natural gas at <a href=\"https://finshots.in/brief/rbi-appointed-directors-lakshmi-vilas-bank/\"><u>$2.39 per MMBTU</u></a> even though it cost them $3.70 to extract it. Basically, they were bleeding money on every unit they sold. And other gas producers were in the same boat.</p><p><em>Sidebar: MMBTU stands for “million British Thermal Units”. It’s just a fancy way of measuring energy content. You’ll see this unit a lot when anyone talks about gas prices.</em></p><p>The reason was simple. Regulation. You see, domestic gas prices weren’t market driven but were based on a formula averaging global prices from the US, Canada, the UK and Russia. Every six months, the government would average those prices, do the math and set a new rate. So when global prices crashed during the pandemic, the formula dragged Indian prices down too. For context, in October 2020, domestic gas was priced at just <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/india-slashes-natural-gas-prices-to-multi-year-low-of-1-79/mmbtu/articleshow/78409709.cms?from=mdr&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>$1.79</u></a> per MMBTU.</p><p>Then came the bounce back. As economies reopened, gas demand surged. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, prices spiralled. Europe scrambled to replace Russian gas, turning to LNG. And just like that, <a href=\"https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/lower-lng-prices-trigger-surge-in-asian-spot-market-purchases/108671280?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=That%20is%20still%20far%20below,oil%20and%20liquefied%20petroleum%20gas.\"><u>spot LNG prices in Asia</u></a> went through the roof, touching $70 per mmBtu at one point. And again, India, increasingly dependent on imports, was caught in the crossfire. Thanks to the pricing formula which either passed on high prices to consumers or made it unviable for producers to sustain.</p><p>That’s when the government called in the Dr. Kirit Parikh panel to fix it. And the <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947501&amp;ref=finshots.in#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20such%20natural,a%20floor%20and%20a%20ceiling.\"><u>new formula</u></a>, introduced in April 2023, simplified things. Domestic gas would now be priced at 10% of the Indian crude oil basket, instead of being benchmarked to distant gas surplus countries. There was a floor price of $4 to protect producers and a cap of $6.50 to shield consumers. From April 2025, the cap could rise 4% annually until gas prices are fully deregulated in 2027. It was a Goldilocks solution ― not too high, not too low. ONGC and Oil India finally stopped losing money. City gas distributors like GAIL, IGL and MGL got price stability. And consumers were shielded from global volatility.</p><p>And now, we’re seeing the next step in action. The government has raised the cap for the first time in two years ― from $6.50 to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/natural-gas-to-cost-more-as-govt-raises-price-cap-after-2-years-jury-out-on-cng-hike/articleshow/119818477.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$6.75 per MMBTU</u></a>, exactly as scheduled. And while a 4% hike may not sound like much, it adds up.</p><p>How?</p><p>Well, upstream producers like ONGC benefit as they earn more per unit. But city gas distributors, who supply CNG (compressed natural gas) and PNG (piped natural gas), may have to pass on the higher costs. Industrial users will see bigger bills. Fertiliser companies will demand more subsidies. And the government will have to make room for it in an already tight budget.</p><p>But this hike isn’t happening in isolation. Global gas prices are rising again too. And there’s a bunch of things that are driving the rise.</p><p>For one, there’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2025/03/02/why-natural-gas-prices-are-surging-weather-supply-and-global-demand/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>extreme weather</u></a>. Droughts in China, heatwaves in Europe and cold snaps in the US either spike demand (more heating or cooling) or cripple supply of hydro or wind power. And when renewables fall short, guess what fills the gap? Yup, natural gas.</p><p>Then there’s the surge in LNG exports from major producers like the US, Qatar and Australia. Sure, increased LNG exports may seem like a good thing as it boosts global supply. But it actually tightens the spot market where gas is bought and sold for immediate delivery. Countries with long term contracts (fixed-price deals for a set period) benefit from stable prices. However, countries like India, which rely partly on spot market purchases, face higher and more volatile prices since the demand for LNG keeps the market thin and competitive.</p><p>And finally, there’s currency depreciation. India pays for LNG in dollars. With the dollar hovering around ₹85, even stable dollar prices translate to higher costs in rupee terms. Basically, a weak currency makes everything imported more expensive. That’s why many gas marketing companies are calling for pricing domestic gas <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/buyers-of-natural-gas-call-for-pricing-domestic-gas-in-rupee/articleshow/117310860.cms?from=mdr&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>in rupees</u></a> instead of dollars.</p><p>Put all of these together and these challenges make India’s natural gas ambitions a tightrope walk. Domestic prices aren’t always in sync with global trends, causing trouble for producers and the government alike.</p><p>So, what’s the way out, you ask?</p><p>Well, for starters, India is trying to hedge its bets. We’re boosting domestic production. Oil marketing companies are expanding their natural gas businesses. Companies are signing long term LNG contracts to avoid volatile spot markets. We’re building more LNG terminals, pipelines and city gas networks to expand access. And we’re also exploring alternatives like ethanol blended fuel, electric vehicles and even green hydrogen.</p><p>But the road ahead is long. India’s gas output has been mostly flat for years while demand keeps rising. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that India’s natural gas demand will <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/indias-natural-gas-demand-set-for-60-rise-by-2030-supported-by-upcoming-global-lng-supply-wave?ref=finshots.in\"><u>rise 60%</u></a> by 2030. And limited domestic production means that by the end of this decade, LNG imports will need to more than double to 65 billion cubic metres (bcm) annually to keep up. To top it off, expanding infrastructure is capital intensive and comes with regulated price swings.</p><p>So even in the best case, we can’t become self sufficient anytime soon.</p><p>That said, India can learn from other countries. <a href=\"https://energynews.pro/en/japan-south-korea-and-italy-towards-strategic-cooperation-in-the-lng-market/?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Strategy%20of%20Japan%20and%20its,often%20seen%20as%20too%20restrictive.\"><u>Japan</u></a>, the world’s second largest LNG importer, for example, is moving towards pooling supplies and enabling cargo swaps with South Korea and Italy to bring more flexibility in prices, instead of rigid long-term deals. <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/indias-ethanol-project/\"><u>Brazil</u></a> has scaled up ethanol-powered vehicles. <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/europe-s-shift-from-russian-gas-a-new-energy-era?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=To%20support%20diversification%2C%20Europe's%20LNG,in%20energy%2Drelated%20CO2%20emissions.\"><u>Europe</u></a> is diversifying LNG exports as well as increasing its renewable energy investments. And the US is now the world’s top gas producer with massive shale gas exploration technology.</p><p>While it’s true that India can’t replicate all of these models, we can still move faster on the basics — boosting domestic supply, refining pricing mechanisms and investing in smarter infrastructure.</p><p>Because the bottom line is that India desperately wants gas to power its clean energy future. But gas itself is getting pricier, messier and more unpredictable. So yeah, the real challenge isn’t just using more of it, it’s managing it better.</p><p>And this little 4% hike in April? Maybe it’s a reminder that the age of cheap, predictable gas might be behind us.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+why+natural+gas+prices+are+on+the+rise+and+what+it+means+for+India.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fmi31jm&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fwv29k3&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fdav4cw&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+why+natural+gas+prices+are+on+the+rise+and+what+it+means+for+India.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

And why not? Gold prices have hit an all-time high, smashing records left and right. Yesterday, it touched a jaw dropping <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/commodities/gold-prices-hit-all-time-high-best-quarter-since-1986-us-donald-trump-tariff-worries-19582147.htm?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$3,145</u></a> per troy ounce (about 31.1 grams) in the US, while in India, it soared to ₹91,300 per 10 grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).</p><p>But why is gold on fire?</p><p>Well, blame it on Trump’s tariff threats. Markets are panicking over what these tariffs could do to global trade, and fears of an impending trade war have everyone running to the safest asset in history ― gold.</p><p>See, gold isn’t like money that central banks can print endlessly. It’s a finite resource. To put things in perspective, so far, around <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-gold?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Gold%20mining%20dates%20back%20to,have%20been%20mined%20throughout%20history.\"><u>2.16 lakh tonnes</u></a> or 80% of all economically extractable gold has already been mined. And just about 54,000 tonnes are left buried underground. And when something becomes scarce, it only gets more valuable. That’s why, in times of economic turmoil, everyone from governments and central banks to big investors and folks like you and me rushes to hoard gold.</p><p>But guess who doesn’t buy into this shiny obsession?</p><p>Warren Buffett!</p><p>Yup, the legendary investor has never been a fan of gold, and probably never will be, no matter how high its price climbs. Because gold simply doesn’t fit into his playbook.</p><p>You see, Buffett’s a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-warren-buffett-invest-gold-110056976.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>value investor</u></a>, someone who hunts for assets priced lower than their true worth, expecting the market to catch up and price them right eventually. But gold for him, is an unproductive asset. Unlike stocks, which generate profits and dividends, and have a company behind them that sells goods and services through some value creation, gold just… sits there. It doesn’t grow, innovate or pay you back in any way. Neither is it anything like its cousin <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/can-new-battery-tech-boost-silvers-fortunes/\"><u>silver</u></a>, which at least, has industrial applications. It goes into your gadgets and even electric vehicle batteries. But gold has little utility beyond being shiny and desirable.</p><p>Buffett explained it beautifully in his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2011ltr.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>2011 letter</u></a> to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders. He painted a simple picture:</p><blockquote><em>Imagine a giant cube made of all the gold in the world. It would weigh about 170,000 metric tons and have a value of $9.6 trillion. Now, for that same amount of money, you could buy all the farmland in the US (400 million acres generating $200 billion annually), 16 ExxonMobils (then the most profitable company in the world), and still have a trillion dollars in cash left over. A century from now, that farmland would have produced massive amounts of crops, ExxonMobil would have paid trillions in dividends, and yet… the gold cube would remain unchanged, doing nothing. Sure, you can touch it, admire it, even hoard it, but it won’t make you money.</em></blockquote><p>But then you could argue that gold is undervalued and never holds the same price over time. For instance, if we valued gold the old-school way, like when the <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/what-is-de-dollarization-anyway/\"><u>US dollar was backed by it</u></a>, its fair price today would be much higher. Sure, we don’t follow that system anymore, but if you just used it as a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddganos/2013/07/07/is-gold-really-worth-40000-per-ounce/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>benchmark</u></a>, you’d notice something interesting. The US Federal Reserve’s total M2 money supply stands at around <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm\"><u>$21.6 trillion</u></a>. Think of M2 money supply as all the money that’s easily accessible in an economy but also includes some savings that aren’t immediately available for spending. Meanwhile, the US government holds approximately <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=155805&amp;rid=426&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>261 million troy ounces</u></a> of gold (the largest among central banks worldwide). If you do the math, gold’s fair price should be around $75,000 an ounce, suggesting that it’s undervalued by 95% at today’s price.</p><p>Sounds crazy, right?</p><p>But there’s a flaw here, which we’ve already told you about at the start. Unlike gold, money isn’t limited. Governments can print as much as they want. So, pegging gold’s value to money supply is like using a moving target.</p><p>And that begs the question: If gold doesn’t generate income and might not be undervalued, why does its price keep rising?</p><p>Well, the short answer is fear.</p><p>People invest in gold because they’re scared. Scared of inflation, recessions, wars and financial meltdowns. They don’t buy gold for what it does. They buy it hoping that someone else will be willing to pay more for it later. It’s eerily similar to the famous <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/bloom-and-doom-how-obsession-with-tulips-caused-an-economic-crash-8297101.htm?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Tulip Mania</u></a> of the 1600s. This was one of the first financial bubbles recorded in history where tulips became a status symbol, and demand skyrocketed, driving prices to absurd levels even as much as 10 times an average person’s annual salary! People kept investing in tulips, believing that the hype would never end. Until it did. Prices collapsed overnight and many were left in financial ruin.</p><p>Gold, of course, has endured through history, but the idea remains the same. It rises because people expect more uncertainty in the future than they have today. It acts as an asset of trust because people have believed in its value for centuries and continue to hope it will hold its value in the years to come. </p><p>Also, let’s not forget that owning gold isn’t free. You need to pay for storage, insurance and security. Those extra costs eat into your returns over time.</p><p>And if you’re still not convinced you could look at its long term returns. If you had invested ₹1 lakh in gold in 1995, by 2024, it would be worth ₹16.5 lakhs. But if you had put that same ₹1 lakh into the BSE SENSEX, you’d have a sweet₹25 lakhs today! The same goes for the S&amp;P 500, which has outpaced gold over time.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"2478\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/04/Gols-vs-Sensex-V3.jpg\" width=\"2160\"/></figure><p>Okay, but then why do people still rush to gold?</p><p>Well, according to an interesting observation by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSITRzwfI7A&amp;t=102s&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Equitymaster</u></a>, it’s all about ‘recency bias’. Basically, while stock market indices have outperformed gold over time, in the last year alone, gold has delivered a solid 29% return, which is three times what the SENSEX managed.</p><p>And that again neatly ties into Buffett’s point too. Gold investing is often driven by fear, not logic. Since the pandemic, both the fear-driven buying of gold and its value have surged. First in 2020, then after the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, and now with fresh geopolitical tensions. And people focus on recent gains rather than long term performance. So it’s no surprise that it’s grabbing attention!</p><p>But does that mean that you should avoid gold completely just because Buffett does?</p><p>Not really. Because gold can be a useful hedge against inflation, just not the perfect one.</p><p>So yeah, even though Warren Buffett isn’t a fan of gold, adding a small chunk of gold to your portfolio isn’t really a bad idea. But going all in just because it looks shiny is probably not the best thing to do.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><strong>Correction:</strong> An earlier version of this story measured gold in ounces (28.35 grams). However, the standard unit for precious metals like gold and silver is always troy ounces (31.1 grams). We regret the error and have now corrected it. So, if you see “ounce” anywhere in the story, just know we mean troy ounce.</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+why+Warren+Buffett+dislikes+gold.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fmcfnun&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fwyy430&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F6vuksh&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+why+Warren+Buffett+dislikes+gold.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

Imagine someone in India suffering from a rare genetic disease. And for years, there’s been no cure. But one day, like magic, a foreign pharmaceutical company develops a breakthrough treatment. It patents the drug and begins selling it in India.</p><p>But here’s the catch. The medicine costs a bomb. Unable to afford it, the patient slowly suffers and, eventually, passes away.</p><p>What you just read, dear folks, isn’t an imaginary example or an isolated one. It’s the reality for <a href=\"https://www.rocheindia.com/solutions/focus-areas/rare-diseases?ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Spinal%20Muscular%20Atrophy%20(SMA)%20is,genetic%20cause%20of%20infant%20mortality.\"><u>1 in 7,700 people</u></a> born in India. In fact, as you read this, around 4,000 Indians are battling Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/health/story/spinal-muscular-atrophy-financial-burden-rare-genetic-disorder-india-2592766-2024-09-16?ref=finshots.in\"><u>genetic disorder</u></a> that affects the nerves. For the uninitiated, the normal human body needs a protein called SMN (survival motor neuron) to perform basic functions like moving, swallowing and even breathing. But in SMA patients, the body doesn’t produce enough of it, leading to a lifetime of struggle.</p><p>And since diseases don’t discriminate based on financial status, many patients never get the treatment they need. That said, SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant deaths in India. What’s even worse is that 1 in 38 people unknowingly carry the faulty gene responsible for it.</p><p>In 2021 though, a ray of hope emerged ― a drug called Risdiplam, sold as Evrysdi by Swiss pharma giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (we’ll just call it Roche from here on). It helped SMA patients produce more of the SMN protein, allowing them to manage their condition better, even if it wasn’t a complete cure.</p><p>The only problem? A year’s supply of Evrysdi costs anywhere between <a href=\"https://www.barandbench.com/news/supreme-court-stays-allahabad-high-court-observation-that-grabbing-minors-breasts-is-notattempttorape?ref=finshots.in\"><u>₹20 lakhs</u></a> and ₹70 lakhs. That’s because each bottle is priced at around ₹2 lakhs, and patients need at least 30 bottles annually to efficiently manage their condition. While that’s <a href=\"https://www.theweek.in/news/health/2025/03/26/how-delhi-high-court-latest-verdict-is-boon-for-spinal-muscular-atrophy-patients-risdiplam.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>cheaper</u></a> than alternatives like Zolgensma, a gene therapy which costs a staggering ₹17 crores, or even Nusinersen, a drug priced at ₹87 lakhs, Evrysdi is still the most affordable option yet out of reach for most.</p><p>That’s what Natco Pharma, an Indian company, wanted to change. It wanted to manufacture Risdiplam at a fraction of the cost to make it accessible.</p><p>But maybe you’ve already guessed that this didn’t sit well with Roche. After all, its patent for Risdiplam is valid until May 2035, meaning no one else can manufacture it commercially without permission. Natco, however, went ahead anyway. So Roche dragged it to court, asking to block what it saw as a patent violation.</p><p>But here’s the twist. A few days ago, the Delhi High Court refused to block Natco from launching its version of the drug. In the <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:d1896301-f6be-4c15-8fba-de00fa0ad014?ref=finshots.in\"><u>court’s own words</u></a>:</p><blockquote><em>The approved drug, i.e., Risdiplam, which is marketed under the name Evrysdi, is not available at reasonably affordable prices in India. Thus, if a party is able to manufacture the drug and make it available at an affordable price, in such a case, the public interest would have to outweigh the need for grant of injunction.</em></blockquote><p>At this point, you’re probably thinking, “But hey, isn’t this unfair to companies that invest millions in researching and developing life saving drugs?”</p><p>And you wouldn’t be wrong.</p><p>But then you have to understand why Roche couldn’t fully stop Natco from breaking into the market.</p><p>See, pharma companies spend years researching and developing new treatments, pouring in enormous sums of money to find a cure. So when they finally succeed, they safeguard their innovation fiercely and price their drugs high to recover those massive R&amp;D costs. That’s exactly why Evrysdi comes with such a hefty price tag.</p><p>On top of that, the market for the drug is tiny. Only a handful of people need it. So Roche prices it steeply, trying to maximise profits before its patent expires. Because once a generic drug maker steps in, the monopoly vanishes, and so do the sky high profits.</p><p>But look at the economics of Risdiplam, and you’ll see why Roche’s case isn’t as strong. The actual cost of producing a bottle of Evrysdi including active ingredients, packaging and even a 20% profit margin could be <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-72-lakh/year-rare-disease-drug-can-be-made-for-rs-3000/year-hc-told/articleshow/114666406.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>as low as ₹3,000</u></a>. Even if Roche added a whopping 1,000% profit margin, it could still sell the drug in India at a 99% discount to its US price ($11,170 or roughly ₹9.5 lakh per bottle). And that actually raises ethical concerns. Is Roche making a fair profit, or is it exploiting desperate patients?</p><p>Then, there’s the larger debate about patent laws and access to medicines in India. <a href=\"https://finshots.in/markets/an-overview-of-cipla-and-the-pharma-industry/\"><u>Before 1970</u></a>, India only granted patents on the process of making a drug, not the drug itself. This allowed Indian pharma companies to reverse engineer and produce affordable generic (copied versions) medicines. That’s also how India became the “Pharmacy of the World”, supplying low cost medicines globally.</p><p>But things changed in 1995 when India signed the <a href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/role-of-trips-agreement-and-its-scope-in-india/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>TRIPS Agreement</u></a> (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) under the WTO (World Trade Organization). By 2005, Indian patent laws were put at par with global standards, meaning companies could no longer manufacture or sell patented drugs for 20 years without the patent holder’s consent.</p><p>But then TRIPS also included exceptions known as <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2323529/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>TRIPS flexibilities</u></a>. These ensure that public health isn’t compromised, especially when it comes to affordable medicines. And here are three key ones that matter:</p><ol><li><strong>Compulsory licensing</strong>: In cases where a patented drug is either too expensive or fails to meet public demand, pharma companies can legally manufacture a generic version without the patent holder’s consent. This was seen in the 2013 Natco Pharma vs. Bayer Corporation case, where Natco was granted permission to produce a more affordable version of Bayer’s cancer drug.</li><li><strong>No patent evergreening</strong>: Pharma giants can’t extend a patent’s life by making minor tweaks to a drug unless they prove that the changes significantly improve its efficacy. This prevents companies from holding onto patents indefinitely and blocking generic alternatives. A good example is the 2013 Novartis case, where the company tried to extend its patent on Glivec, an anti-cancer drug, but was denied.</li><li><strong>Parallel imports</strong>: If a drug costs $100 in Sweden but sells for $200 in India, Indian pharma companies (or even the government) can import the cheaper version without the patent holder’s approval. This ensures that life saving drugs aren’t priced out of reach simply because of geography.</li></ol><p>These flexibilities exist to strike a balance so that pharma companies get due credit for their innovation, but life saving treatments don’t remain exclusive only to those who can afford them.</p><p>And as we’ve explained earlier, the court weighed these factors in the Roche vs. Natco case and sided with public interest. It acknowledged that Evrysdi was financially out of reach for most SMA patients and also caught Roche trying to unfairly extend its monopoly by using an unfair tactic called “evergreening”. Evergreening, or forever patenting, is when companies extend their patent rights by filing a new patent on an existing drug after making minor tweaks without actually improving its effectiveness. The court saw through this because Roche’s own patent filings in the US, Australia and Canada suggested that Risdiplam was already part of an earlier patent. And if Roche had filed for the original patent in India, it would have expired much sooner.</p><p>And finally, there’s India’s Patents Act (of 2005), which gives the government <a href=\"https://m.thewire.in/article/health/india-must-make-this-life-saving-drug-affordable-for-sma-patients/amp?ref=finshots.in\"><u>the power</u></a> to step in and allow generic drug production when it’s in the public’s best interest.</p><p>So, when the court refused to rule in Roche’s favour, it wasn’t about India <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/indias-disputed-ruling-pharmaceuticals-and-patents?ref=finshots.in\"><u>undervaluing patents</u></a>. It was about ethics. It was about whether foreign pharma giants should be allowed to squeeze Indian markets dry while leaving little room for Indian companies to step in.</p><p>Of course, global pharma firms don’t see it that way. Companies like Novartis have already voiced concerns over India’s patent laws, even <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/journals/pharm_fdi_indian_patent_law.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>shifting</u></a> research centres to Singapore and China, fearing their intellectual property isn’t safe here. They argue that India isn’t letting them innovate.</p><p>But here’s the real question. Are they innovating for the greater good, or are they just running businesses designed to squeeze abnormal profits out of vulnerable people?</p><p>We’ll leave you with that thought.</p><p>Until next time…</p><p>But before you go you should also know that Roche isn’t out of options yet. It can still <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/delhi-hc-restrains-natco-pharma-from-launching-generic-of-roche-s-rare-disease-drug-12976800.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>appeal</u></a> the Delhi High Court’s decision, and if it wins, it could claim damages too.

While the company threw <a href=\"https://www.fortuneindia.com/business-news/blusmart-shuts-down-uber-acquisition-rumours-calls-claims-speculative-and-unfounded/121184?ref=finshots.in\"><u>speculation about Uber</u></a> acquiring it straight out the window, one thing is clear: clouds of troubles are looming. </p><p>And to think, not too long ago, people were celebrating BluSmart, sharing words of appreciation in LinkedIn posts for the quality of service it offered. Investors like BP Ventures and Mayfield India Fund were all in, too. A Zurich-based climate finance firm even poured <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/newsletters/the-gensol-blusmart-issue-is-a-reminder-of-the-perils-of-dilettante-diworsification-anmol-singh-jaggi-puneet-goyal-ola-11742732918120.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$24 million</u></a> into the company about a year ago. So, yeah, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that things were going off without a hitch for BluSmart. </p><p>So then what went wrong, you ask?</p><p>Well, let’s take it from the top.</p><p>See, BluSmart set itself apart by going all-in on electric vehicles (EVs) and positioning itself as the sustainable alternative to Ola and Uber. But there was one key difference in their business models. Ola and Uber relied on drivers who owned or financed their own cars, keeping the financial burden off their balance sheets. BluSmart, on the other hand, had to lease EVs from leasing companies or third-party financiers, exposing it to significant financial risk. Think about it. If leasing costs went up or its leasing partners pulled back, its entire fleet and business model could be at risk.</p><p>And that is exactly what happened.</p><p>At the centre of the storm is Anmol Singh Jaggi, who founded both Gensol Engineering, a public company focused on solar energy and EV leasing and BluSmart, a privately owned EV cab service. But here’s where things get tricky. Gensol wasn’t just any EV leasing company. It secured government-backed loans from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/gensol-blusmart-ev-cab-uber-leasing-mahindra-mahindra-finance-anmol-singh-jaggi-refex-green-ireda-sebi-vijay-mall-11742125101954.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>purchase thousands of EVs</u></a>, most of which ended up in BluSmart’s fleet. Essentially, government-backed money meant for Gensol indirectly fuelled BluSmart’s expansion, with IREDA’s knowledge, of course.</p><p>But there was another layer to this relationship. Gensol’s FY24 annual report disclosed contracts worth over <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/gensol-blusmart-ev-cab-uber-leasing-mahindra-mahindra-finance-anmol-singh-jaggi-refex-green-ireda-sebi-vijay-mall-11742125101954.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>₹148 crores with BluSmart’s subsidiaries</u></a>, raising questions about just how intertwined the two companies really were.</p><p>The problem? While BluSmart thrived, Gensol’s public investors weren’t directly benefitting because BluSmart wasn’t a Gensol subsidiary. It remained a separate private entity. Plus, Gensol wasn’t exactly transparent about how much money was flowing into BluSmart.</p><p>BluSmart argued that all these deals were fair and independent, conducted at arm’s length and approved by the board. But with the companies closely tied, questions about corporate governance started to pop up.</p><p>Then came the real blow. By the end of 2024, Gensol had unpaid loans of <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/gensol-blusmart-ev-cab-uber-leasing-mahindra-mahindra-finance-anmol-singh-jaggi-refex-green-ireda-sebi-vijay-mall-11742125101954.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>₹470 crores towards IREDA</u></a>. As a result, credit ratings agencies, including CARE and ICRA downgraded Gensol’s debt to default status, accusing it of hiding key financial details. And that naturally sent Gensol’s stock price nosediving, forcing the company to make a tough call. <br/><br/>It had to eventually decide to sell off nearly 3,000 EVs to Refex Green Mobility to cut its debt. But then, <a href=\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/d0714805-21c4-46f3-a967-d0fff18795c0.pdf?ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Refex called off that deal</a> a few days ago, which has put BluSmart in deeper trouble. It has to find a different way out to pare its debt. </p><p>And with Gensol out of the picture, BluSmart is also struggling to raise funds.</p><p>But there’s another question here: Did BluSmart get an unfair advantage all along?</p><p>See, the thing is that with Gensol financing its expansion and providing cars, BluSmart had a relatively easy ride. But now that its closest ally is gone, it has little leverage in securing favourable lease terms. And with its losses mounting to <a href=\"https://inc42.com/buzz/blusmart-breaks-down-groww-eyes-200-mn-more/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>₹215 crores in FY23</u></a> along with mounting complaints from poor customer service, things are getting tougher.</p><p>Although BluSmart says that it has diversified its leasing partnerships with <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/how-blusmarts-closest-ally-became-its-biggest-risk/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Orix, Kinto and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</u></a>, however, with over a third of its fleet coming from Gensol, which is now out of the equation, its ability to scale independently is in question.</p><p>So this was the long and short of it.</p><p>All things aside, at the heart of it all lies a broader entrepreneurial lesson.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/newsletters/the-gensol-blusmart-issue-is-a-reminder-of-the-perils-of-dilettante-diworsification-anmol-singh-jaggi-puneet-goyal-ola-11742732918120.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Sundeep Khanna from Mint</u></a> pointed out about Gensol and BluSmart, as a cautionary tale of spreading too thin. In easy terms, expanding into related businesses can fuel innovation and create operational synergies. But when companies diversify into entirely unrelated sectors, things can go downhill fast. </p><p>In this case, running two capital-intensive businesses, EV leasing and ride-hailing, may have stretched Anmol Singh Jaggi beyond his limits.</p><p>The lesson here is diversification works best when businesses stay within their circle of competence. Unrelated expansions may look lucrative at first, but they often lead to governance lapses, financial mismanagement and, ultimately, a house of cards waiting to collapse. (We must also note that this theory may not always hold true!) </p><p>That said, we’re not here to pass verdicts. Gensol could still be cleared of any wrongdoing. But the damage is already done. Gensol’s stock has tanked, BluSmart is scrambling, and investors are questioning the business model itself.</p><p>So now, the question remains. Can BluSmart truly stand on its own, or was it always just riding on borrowed time?</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=In+this+story%2C+we+break+down+what%E2%80%99s+ailing+BluSmart.++https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fmedyfa&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fvv9x80&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fie81zg&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=In+this+story%2C+we+break+down+what%E2%80%99s+ailing+BluSmart.+&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Note: An earlier version of this story wrongly mentioned that Gensol Engineering had sold nearly 3,000 EVs to Refex Engineering.

                    "content": "<section class=\"gh-content gh-canvas\">\n<p>Hey folks!</p><p>Imagine you’ve got a brilliant idea for an app, but there’s just one problem. You don’t know a thing about coding. Hiring a developer sounds expensive, and suddenly, your excitement crashes before it even takes off.</p><p>But what if you could build that app without writing a single line of code? Enter vibe coding, a term that’s taken the internet by storm.</p><p>Coined by <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/vibe-coding-explained-article-12976971.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Andrej Karpathy</u></a>, co-founder of OpenAI and former AI lead at Tesla, vibe coding is all about “fully giving in to the vibes” and “forgetting that the code even exists”. In simple terms, it means you tell an AI model like ChatGPT, Claude or Copilot what you want in plain English, and it spits out the code for you. You test it, tweak it and just like that, you’re a programmer!</p><p>Sounds like magic, right? Well, that’s why the internet is buzzing about whether mid-level engineers are doomed. It’s kind of like how GPT-4o, OpenAI’s latest image generation model, <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/openai-new-ai-model-just-made-everyone-a-designer-overnight-ghibli/\"><u>made everyone a designer</u></a> overnight.</p><p>But hold on. Knowing how to code isn’t just about typing lines of code on a screen. It’s about understanding how things work underneath. Think of it like this. Back in the 1990s, turning on a desktop was a process. You had to power up the CPU, switch on the monitor and connect to dial-up internet. You learned how everything fit together. And over time, this basic knowledge helped you navigate everything from defragmenting hard drives to figuring out the difference between WordPad and Microsoft Word.</p><p>Now, fast forward to today. Our parents are pros at scrolling social media and forwarding WhatsApp messages. But explain to them that their phone storage is full because of those “Good Morning” or “Good Night” picture messages, and suddenly, you’re met with confusion. “But I didn’t download anything!” they’ll say.</p><p>Without understanding the mechanics, even simple fixes become impossible. Just ask my dad. He somehow has five Facebook accounts, none of which he can access (password forgotten, no phone number linked for password recovery), and he wants me to magically delete the extra accounts.</p><p>The same logic applies to vibe coding. AI can churn out code, but if something goes wrong, it won’t magically fix itself because it’s the model that made this mistake in the first place. You need to know <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2473993-what-is-vibe-coding-should-you-be-doing-it-and-does-it-matter/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>how to troubleshoot</u></a>. So, while vibe coding sounds revolutionary, engineers aren’t going anywhere just yet.</p><p>Maybe AI’s got the vibes, but human expertise still runs the show for now!</p><p><strong>Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxaeRhk35mY&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Dekho Na</u></a> by Raman Sharma</p><p><strong>What caught our eye this week 👀</strong></p><p><em>How goli soda became a global hero</em></p><p>Remember goli soda? That local fizzy drink in a quirky glass bottle sealed with a marble? You just had to push the marble down, and “pop” it went!</p><p>Drinking it today sure feels like a rush of nostalgia in every sip.</p><p>But guess what? It’s gone global!</p><p>Rebranded as “<a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2114131&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Goli Pop Soda</u></a>”, this iconic Indian beverage has made its way to the US, UK, Europe and the Gulf. A partnership with Fair Exports India even secured its spot in Lulu Hypermarket, where it’s flying off the shelves.</p><p>But hey, wasn’t goli soda <a href=\"https://food.ndtv.com/news/what-is-goli-soda-how-this-beloved-desi-soda-has-been-rebranded-into-a-trendy-drink-8015324?ref=finshots.in\"><u>nearly wiped out</u></a> by the likes of Coca Cola and Pepsi in the late 1990s? Bottling costs soared, hygiene concerns scared people away and the desi favourite slowly fizzled out.</p><p>So how did it stage a comeback, that too on a global scale, you ask?</p><p>Well, the answer lies in reinvention.</p><p>For context, goli soda (aka goti soda or banta soda) dates back to British India, packaged in codd-neck bottles that were first imported from Britain before being made locally. Street vendors, called “bantawalas”, turned it into a cultural staple, selling flavoured sodas on roadside carts.</p><p>But then, multinational soda giants entered the Indian market and shook things up. Their aggressive marketing made survival tough for local goli soda makers. For context, the iconic codd-neck bottles alone made up a whopping <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-fizz-is-back-in-goli-soda-drink-up/articleshow/94746973.cms?ref=finshots.in\"><u>96%</u></a> of production costs, squeezing profits dry. And eventually, the beloved desi fizz faded away.</p><p>Then, in 2017, something unexpected happened — the Jallikattu protests in Tamil Nadu. For the uninitiated, these were youth-led protests pushing to lift the Supreme Court’s ban on Jallikattu, a centuries old Tamil Nadu tradition where participants try to grab and tame a bull as it charges through the crowd. As people rallied to protect their cultural heritage, all things local saw a resurgence. And goli soda was one of them.</p><p>Sensing an opportunity, entrepreneurs stepped in. They swapped glass bottles for cost effective plastic ones, improved hygiene with extra protective seals and introduced trendy flavours like passion fruit, blueberry and mojito alongside classics like jeera and lemon. The nostalgic charm, paired with modern upgrades, struck a chord, not just in India but globally too.</p><p>Sales have doubled over the last five years, proving that nostalgia actually sells.</p><p>But here’s the bittersweet part. While goli soda thrives in its premium avatar, the “bantawalas” who made it an icon have faded into history.</p><p>And that makes us think: Premiumisation is in, but at what cost?</p><p><strong>Infographic 📊</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"4050\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/03/OTT-Users-V8.png\" width=\"3240\"/></figure><p><strong>This Day in Financial History 📜</strong></p><p><em>30th of March, 1867 ― The US bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million</em></p><p>On this day, US Secretary of State William H Seward and Russian envoy Baron Edouard de Stoeckl sealed a deal called the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-russia-gave-alaska-americas-gateway-arctic-180962714/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Treaty of Cession</u></a>, that redrew the world map overnight. And just like that, Alaska, once a distant Russian region, became part of the US.</p><p>Today, Alaska is literally a goldmine, rich in oil, fish and minerals. Plus, its strategic location gives the US a front row seat to the Arctic while keeping an eye on its old Cold War rival, Russia.</p><p>But why did Russia sell it in the first place?</p><p>Well, the short answer is Britain.</p><p>Confused? Let’s explain.</p><p>Back in the 18th century, a Danish explorer, originally sailing for Russia, accidentally reached Alaska. And his crew discovered a treasure trove. No, we’re not talking about gold, but sea otters. Their fur was all the rage in international markets. And soon, this led to Russian traders moving in and dominating both Alaska and the fur trade. By the end of the 18th century, the then Russian emperor granted a <a href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/23svyatoy-nikolai/features/russian-america/russian-america.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Russian-American company</u></a> a monopoly over Alaska’s fur trade, effectively making it an official Russian territory.</p><p>But governing this icy land was no easy feat. It was sparsely populated, far from Moscow and nearly impossible to defend.</p><p>Then came the Crimean War, where Russia found itself locked in battle with Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. The war drained Russia’s finances and exposed its military weaknesses. To make matters worse, Britain, which controlled Canada, was an ever-growing threat. <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1994/winter/alaska-check?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Russia feared</u></a> that if war broke out again, Alaska might fall into British hands, without a single ruble in return.</p><p>So, rather than risk losing it for nothing, Russia sold it to a friendly power, one that also happened to be Britain’s rival, the US.</p><p>Yup, we know it’s crazy. But back then, Russia and the US <a href=\"https://www.wionews.com/world/why-did-russia-sell-alaska-to-the-united-states-434289?ref=finshots.in\"><u>were actually allies</u></a>. And that unlikely friendship is exactly how Alaska ended up on the American map.</p><p>P.S.: Fast forward to today, imagine if Trump’s dream of buying Greenland or even absorbing Canada ever came true.

It’s kind of the ultimate dream, and despite massive advancements in AI, we've always seemed to be just out of reach. </p><p>However, OpenAI’s latest image generation model (4o) changes this. It has probably brought us within touching distance of the promised land, if not directly into it. This new model is breathtaking. It seems to get everything right. It can create photorealistic images, it doesn’t mess up the figures, it understands context, and it’s turned everyone into an overnight designer.</p><p>How do you even make sense of something like this? </p><p>Well, let’s start from the top and ask the most obvious question. </p><p>Why does it work so well and why can’t other models replicate this?</p><p>Well, there’s an excellent article on “The Verge” explaining this. But if you want a simple explainer, here’s one–</p><p>GPT-4o is an “omnimodal” model, meaning it understands and connects different types of data — like text, images, even audio and video. It also understands prompts better because it was trained to grasp the meaning behind words and images together, rather than strictly following the exact words given. Other models often just follow prompts literally, so you have to provide more details to get the right result. But GPT-4o can guess what you meant even if you don't say everything clearly, making its images match your intention more naturally.</p><p>It’s also different from diffusion models.</p><p>These models work by starting with random noise and slowly shaping it into an image, based on the prompt. Every time you want to change something — even a small part — you usually have to regenerate the whole image or use special techniques to edit it. They’re great at making high-quality pictures, but they’re not very interactive or smart about making step-by-step changes.</p><p>The new 4o image generator is a token-based model that treats images more like language. They “see” the image as a sequence of tokens (like words) and can understand and update specific parts, just like editing a sentence. So if you say “add a tree” or “move the chess piece”, the model can just change that part of the image without touching everything else.</p><p>Also, since it knows a lot about the world already, it’s really really good at what it does. </p><p>This will, no doubt, change a few things. </p><p>Marketers and businesses will now have a powerful tool to create and iterate on visuals in real time, without needing advanced design skills. For instance, they can dynamically generate product images with different colours and styles tailored to individual users. They can run extensive A/B tests or adapt entire ad campaigns by describing any updates in plain language. E-commerce platforms can personalise product visuals per customer, while product teams can rapidly prototype UI and UX designs by turning rough ideas into instant visual mockups. Content creators meanwhile will benefit from the ability to adapt or refine their thumbnails on the fly.</p><p>There’s something in it for everyone. Including OpenAI. This will definitely help them attract a whole bunch of new users. And as more users interact with the platform, OpenAI will gather more data to continuously improve its models. It could be a virtuous cycle and offer the company a massive edge as the AI race gathers momentum. </p><p>However, there is one problem that we haven’t discussed yet. What does this mean for designers and graphic artists? If anybody can create compelling visuals with a simple prompt, will their jobs cease to exist? </p><p>Well, people often exaggerate doom when it comes to these things. </p><p>Folks in the 19th century believed mechanised looms would eliminate textile jobs, but the industry expanded, creating new factory-based roles instead. The introduction of ATMs was supposed to make bank tellers redundant, yet their numbers only increased as banks redirected employees toward customer service and sales roles. Personal computers, initially seen as potential job killers, birthed entirely new industries in IT and software development. Even e-commerce, once feared as the end of traditional retail, evolved into an integrated model where traditional brick-and-mortar stores and online platforms work together. </p><p>Humans adapt. That’s what they do. And guess what? Designers will adopt these new advancements and co-opt them into their workflows. The only question is – Who’s smart enough to do it quickly? </p><p>That we will have to wait and see. </p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+how+GPT-4o+could+change+the+design+world.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F7o5psb&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F92hplq&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fk7ud3g&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+how+GPT-4o+could+change+the+design+world.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story </h3><p>India is one of the world’s largest tyre manufacturing nations, producing around <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/atma-seek-ban-on-import-of-wastescrap-tyres-into-india/article69149474.ece?ref=finshots.in\"><u>20 crore tyres</u></a> annually. And it’s not just domestic demand that keeps the industry running, our tyre exports are thriving too. In fact, we exported tyres worth over <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/indian-tyre-exports-surge-117-in-fy-2024-25-h1-valued-at-12131-crore-driven-by-rd-investments-and-global-demand/article68913813.ece?ref=finshots.in\"><u>₹12,000 crores</u></a> in just the first half of FY25. And guess where most of them go? To the United States (US). The US accounts for more than 15% of our tyre exports in value terms. Brazil, Germany, the UAE, France and Italy follow close behind. And when it comes to motorcycle tyres, Colombia in South America is our biggest customer.</p><p>But here’s the catch. While we export fresh tyres, many Western nations are also sending us something in return: their used-up, <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/atma-seek-ban-on-import-of-wastescrap-tyres-into-india/article69149474.ece?ref=finshots.in\"><u>end-of-life tyres (ELTs)</u></a>.</p><p>Now, these ELTs are essentially waste, shipped to India for recycling. And their sheer volume is staggering, to say the least. To put this in perspective, in 2023 alone, India received <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/can-rubber-tyres-really-go-green-apollo-tyres-goodyear/\"><u>800,000 tonnes</u></a> of scrapped tyres. And here’s another sobering fact. India actually purchases over <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/old-tires-from-western-countries-fuel-a-crisis-in-countries-like-india-and-malaysia?ref=finshots.in\"><u>30%</u></a> of the world’s scrapped tyres. If you’re wondering why, we’ll talk about it a little later in the story. </p><p>However, what’s causing ripples in environmental communities and tyre associations in both India and the United Kingdom (UK) is that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14jy2dd8jeo?ref=finshots.in\"><u>nearly half</u></a> of the tyre scrap to India comes from just one country: the UK. And the sheer amount of pollution it’s causing is alarming.</p><p>How’s that, you ask?</p><p>You see, this tyre scrap that lands in India is meant for recycling. And when done right, tyres undergo quite the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shubham14684/performance-of-india-when-compared-to-other-nations-in-tyre-recycling-102cc1ccec47?ref=finshots.in\"><u>transformation</u></a>.</p><p>Take the steel, for instance. It makes up about 20% of a tyre. Once extracted, it’s cleaned and sent to smelters, where it finds new life in construction and manufacturing. Then there’s the fibre and nylon, around 15% of the mix, which ends up in carpets, fibreglass and clean-up materials such as absorbent pads and mats used for things like oil spills.</p><p>And the rest is mostly rubber. But that doesn’t go to waste either. Some of it turns into tyre-derived fuel (TDF), shredded scrap tyres that supplement traditional fires in controlled industrial settings. Then there’s rubber mulch, a favourite for playgrounds and gardens, and crumb rubber, which gets repurposed for athletic tracks, road surfaces and speed bumps. If processed further, it becomes rubber powder, a high-performance material used in plastics, sealants and even new rubber products.</p><p>So yeah, nearly every part of a recycled tyre finds a new destination with a useful purpose.</p><p>However, the problem starts when these ELTs, especially from the UK, end up in illegal pyrolysis plants across India.</p><p>Pyrolysis, in simple terms, is like extreme cooking. Tyres are heated in an oxygen-free environment at around 500°C to extract fuel and other byproducts. But when done improperly, it turns into an environmental disaster. These makeshift plants release a cocktail of toxins: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/worse-than-plastic-burning-tyres-india-george-monbiot?ref=finshots.in\"><u>heavy metals, benzene, dioxins and furans</u></a> — many of which are highly carcinogenic. You can spot these illegal setups by the thick soot in the air, dying vegetation and polluted waterways nearby.</p><p>The plant owners, of course, make money. But environmental concerns and public health aren’t exactly on their priority list.</p><p>And that begs the question: Why is the UK dumping its tyre waste in India anyway?</p><p>It’s not like they lack the infrastructure to recycle tyres at home. They do. But sending them abroad is simply cheaper. Investing in shredding machinery is expensive, and Indian pyrolysis plants are willing to pay more for scrap tyres.</p><p>In the UK, scrap tyres were once compressed into blocks for road foundations, embankments and drainage beds. But the companies making these blocks have either shut down or are struggling because they can’t compete with the prices Indian recyclers offer. Add to this the rising demand for industrial fuel, cheap Chinese-made pyrolysis machines (which otherwise cost tens of millions of dollars) available for as little as <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/trading-tyres-how-the-west-fuels-a-waste-crisis-in-asia-1610714-2019-10-18?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$30,000</u></a>, and weak regulations, and the trade is thriving.</p><p>And here’s the real kicker. Tyres aren’t classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. So, unless the importing country explicitly bans them, there are hardly any restrictions on the global tyre trade.</p><p>The irony here is that we as a country already generate a massive pile of waste tyres domestically, about 2,75,000 every day, as per a 2021 MoHUA report. Yet, we continue to import millions more, worsening the crisis.</p><p>Also, the UK’s regulations are laughably lax. Exporters just declare their buyers, and the UK checks with India if these buyers are legitimate. But after that there’s no tracking, no accountability, not even official export figures.</p><p>Becoming a tyre trader in the UK is ridiculously easy, too. All you have to do is fill out a simple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/worse-than-plastic-burning-tyres-india-george-monbiot?ref=finshots.in\"><u>“U2 environmental exemption”</u></a> form, collect used tyres, and while they’re technically meant for construction, nothing stops traders from shipping them straight to India. Once the tyres leave British shores, the UK washes its hands of them.</p><p>The Indian government, however, has started cracking down. The Ministry of Environment has banned the import of waste tyres meant for pyrolysis. The Central Pollution Control Board, acting on directives from the National Green Tribunal, has already shut down <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/cpcb-orders-shutdown-of-270-tyre-pyrolysis-units-in-19-states-for-causing-pollution-119120501231_1.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>270 illegal pyrolysis plants across 19 states</u></a>. And to add another layer of accountability, a new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework now makes tyre manufacturers responsible for collecting and properly disposing of waste tyres.</p><p>But despite these efforts, the problem persists. The Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (ATMA) is now pushing for a complete ban on waste tyre imports, pointing out that these imports have surged fivefold since FY21.</p><p>Now, the onus lies on the UK. Just like Australia that completely banned exporting these ELTs to other countries, if the UK follows suit, then the crisis in India can be controlled. </p><p>And if this doesn’t happen, the question is, will India put its foot down before the crisis spirals further?</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A+story+where+we+break+down+how+tyre+recycling+issues+are+fueling+an+environmental+crisis+in+India.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fxln5l1&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fbdy1da&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fkr827f&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=A+story+where+we+break+down+how+tyre+recycling+issues+are+fueling+an+environmental+crisis+in+India.&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>If you’d looked up online dating in 2019, you’d have thought the business was booming. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/online-dating-big-business/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>1 in 5</u></a> couples worldwide had met through a dating app. People loved the simplicity of just quickly swiping right or left to choose or drop a potential match. It’s no wonder that <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2024/08/08/why-people-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-dating-apps?ref=finshots.in\"><u>250 million</u></a> people globally had a dating app on their phone back then.</p><p>Then came 2021, and things got even better. The pandemic locked everyone indoors, pushing dating, like everything else, onto the internet. With more people than ever looking for love online, it seemed like the perfect moment for Bumble to go public. And when it did, its market capitalisation hit $13 billion on the first day of trading.</p><p>But if you had invested in Bumble back then, thinking that online dating was the next big thing, well… let’s just say that investment would be worth peanuts today. That’s because Bumble’s market capitalisation has now plummeted to about $720 million, which means that a $1,000 investment in its stock would be worth <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bumble-bmbl-shares-getting-171752890.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>just $66</u></a> today.</p><p>And it’s not just Bumble. Match Group, the company behind Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OKCupid, Hinge, Grindr and Plenty of Fish, has also seen its stock take a beating. It’s down <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bumble-stock-price-dating-apps-tinder-hinge-sell-users-revenue-2025-2?ref=finshots.in\"><u>nearly 80%</u></a> from its peak in 2021. And when these companies recently reported weaker-than-expected earnings, their stock prices only dropped further.</p><p>So, what went wrong with online dating, you ask?</p><p>To get to the bottom of this, you first need to understand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgtg8ZzTV7E&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>how dating apps make money</u></a>. Contrary to what many believe, online dating isn’t a new phenomenon. It actually dates back to <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/what-was-the-first-online-dating-site?ref=finshots.in\"><u>1995</u></a> when Gary Kremen, a Stanford graduate, had a lightbulb moment. “Why not use the internet to help people find love?”, he thought.</p><p>At the time, the internet was still a novelty, but dating was expensive. People had to use premium-rate phone lines that charged $3 per minute to connect with potential matches. So Kremen’s idea was simple ― make dating cheaper and more accessible. That’s how Match.com was born.</p><p>Fast forward a few decades, and Match Group had become an industry giant. But there was one problem. Dating apps were too efficient. If people found their perfect match quickly, they’d leave. And fewer users meant less money.</p><p>So, dating apps found a way to keep users hooked. They adopted a freemium model which meant that they were free to join, but the premium features were locked behind a paywall. Want better profiles? Pay up. Unlimited swipes? That’ll cost extra. Even visibility within the app came with a price tag. The goal wasn’t just to help people find love, it was to keep them swiping for as long as possible.</p><p>But this strategy backfired. Users started experiencing something called ‘dating app fatigue’, where sifting through endless profiles became exhausting. Even when they found a match, there was no guarantee that the other person was looking for the same kind of relationship. The cycle repeated — swipe, match, chat, move on. And over time, people started losing interest. The proof is in the pudding. Global dating app downloads have been falling from 287 million in 2020 to about 237 million in 2023.</p><p>And then there’s the trust issue. Many users misrepresent themselves online, leading to disappointment and eroding faith in dating apps. This loss of trust, combined with the paradox of choice, has made people less willing to pay for these services. And when paying users drop, so do revenues.</p><p>You could look at how pathetic the earnings results have recently been. <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Match-Group-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Match Group’s revenue</u></a> in 2024 was $3.5 billion, up by a measly 3% from the previous year, while its paying users dropped by 5% to 14.9 million. The last quarter was even worse. Revenues declined by 1%, and paying users fell by 4%. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bumble-full-2024-earnings-eps-122521215.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Bumble</u></a> had a similar story to tell. It generated $1.07 billion in 2024, with revenue growing just 2%. What’s worse is that its losses widened from $552 million in 2023 to $557 million in 2024. And analysts now predict that its revenue could shrink by an average of 1.3% every year for the next three years.</p><p>So, does this mean online dating is doomed?</p><p>Well, not quite. That’s because the real game for dating apps isn’t about trapping users in an endless cycle of swipes. It’s about figuring out why people are losing interest in paying for the experience in the first place.</p><p>One big reason is that after the pandemic, more people, especially Gen Z have started ditching dating apps and are opting for real-world connections instead. They’re still potential users, but they’re not the kind to shell out money for a date when they can simply meet new people at clubs, colleges or social events, all for free.</p><p>Even Match Group admitted this shift. In a <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/tinder-rolls-out-new-in-app-feature-for-college-students-in-india-heres-how-to-access-tinder-u-11742296983478.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>letter to shareholders</u></a> last year, it noted that younger users were looking for “a lower pressure, more authentic way to find connections”.</p><p>So Tinder decided to switch things up. Instead of just virtual matches, it started hosting <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-10-12/hard-times-for-tinder-and-bumble-why-investors-are-cashing-in-their-dating-app-stock.html?ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in-person meet-ups</a>. Think cooking classes, running clubs and other activities where sparks could fly naturally.</p><p>But Match Group isn’t stopping there. It has mastered the art of dominating the online dating space — snapping up competitors before they become real threats. And this strategy could actually work in its favour. These days, people don’t want to scroll through a generic dating app and feel lost. They want something tailored to their needs. So when niche apps like Muzz (a British dating and marriage app for the Muslim community) start gaining traction, Match knows it needs to pay attention and maybe even make a move.</p><p>That’s exactly why Match went on to acquire different dating apps over the years. Take Hinge, for example. Those looking for serious relationships are more likely to choose it over Tinder. LGBTQ+ users gravitate towards Grindr. This shift towards niche dating apps isn’t just about preference. It’s proving to be more profitable as well.</p><p>Just look at the numbers. In 2024, Hinge’s direct revenue surged 39% year-over-year to $550 million, driven by a 23% increase in paying users (1.5 million) and a 13% rise in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to $29.94. Grindr’s full-year results weren’t broken down separately, but its first half of 2024 showed a similar growth streak. Revenues jumped 34% to $117 million, while gross operating profit climbed 40% to $68 million, powered by over 14 million active users. Compare that to Tinder’s modest 1% rise in direct revenue and 8% ARPU increase, and you’ll see why Match is doubling down on specialised dating platforms.</p><p>Bumble is taking notes too. Last year, it acquired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/bumble-buys-community-building-app-geneva-to-expand-further-into-friendships/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Geneva</u></a>, an online platform that helps people form real-world groups and clubs. In 2022, it also bought <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/bumble-says-its-looking-to-ma-to-drive-growth/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Fruitz</u></a>, a dating app tailored to the French community.</p><p>These moves signal a shift that dating apps are no longer just about swiping.</p><p>But will these changes be enough to revive the industry?</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><p>Until then, love, or at least the business of it, remains a work in progress.</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+why+the+online+dating+app+business+has+run+into+a+growth+slowdown.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fu2og0x&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fe8145x&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fx1kwuj&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+why+the+online+dating+app+business+has+run+into+a+growth+slowdown.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

He proudly announced a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo?ref=finshots.in\"><u>25% tariff on all steel and aluminium</u></a> imports from around the world. And he didn’t stop there. He also threatened to slap an extra <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-list-products-canada-mexico-china-b41351df?ref=finshots.in\"><u>25% tariff on imported copper</u></a>. </p><p>Naturally, this didn’t sit well with America’s major trading partners. And in response, the EU, Canada and China slapped retaliatory tariffs on US imports. But, Trump wasn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet, so he made it clear that the US would slap reciprocal tariffs on any trading partner that would mirror the tariffs on US products. </p><p>But before we go further, here’s a quick breakdown of what tariffs are and how they work.</p><p>Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. The companies that bring foreign goods into the country pay a percentage of a product’s value as tax to the government. For example, a 25% tariff on European goods means a product worth $10 has an additional $2.5 charge, now costing $12.5 for US consumers. Now essentially, tariffs are an economic tool meant to protect domestic industries from cheaper imports. Because firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. This makes imported goods expensive and forces customers to opt for cheaper domestically manufactured alternatives.</p><p>But then there can be a flip side to this too. The imported product may be more functional than the homemade one because manufacturing for it hasn’t taken off very efficiently. And something similar is playing out in the US right now.</p><p>Trump’s new tariffs could drive up consumer prices in the US and around the globe. And that’s exactly what’s giving economists sleepless nights. </p><p>So then why is he so hell-bent on imposing them, you ask?</p><p>Well, for Trump, <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/why-trump-sent-canada-and-mexico-into-a-tariff-panic/\"><u>tariffs</u></a> are a way to boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, raise tax revenue and grow the domestic economy. With tariffs in place, Trump also intends to restore America’s trade balance with its foreign partners. And he’s particularly focused on the EU, where the US had a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$213 billion trade deficit</u></a> in 2024, something he once called “an atrocity”.</p><p>But last week, something ironic happened.</p><p>The US Department of Agriculture requested certain EU nations — Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Lithuania, to export eggs to the US. That’s because bird flu has wiped out millions of hens, causing a massive egg shortage and soaring prices in the US. And that has sort of given the European social media a field day, mocking Trump and terming his request “door-to-door begging”.</p><p>Seems like Trump is having to eat humble pie, no?</p><p>Just a few days ago he was threatening the EU with tariffs and now the US needs European eggs. However, the bigger takeaway here is that we live in a deeply interconnected world where trade between countries and continents is indispensable.</p><p>And that’s where tariffs come in. They may seem like a protective shield, but they often come with hidden costs.</p><p>Take Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on copper. It is already causing ripples in the market. The London Metal Exchange (LME), a key commodities exchange for industrial metals, has seen copper prices surge past <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6eb77e4-252e-424c-8708-909be483e138?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$10,000 per tonne</u></a>. Meanwhile, traders in New York are scrambling to secure copper supplies, pushing up prices on the Commodity Exchange (Comex), the primary futures and options market for metals in the US. The price gap between LME and Comex copper futures has hit a record $1,254 per tonne.</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>See, Copper is a critical raw material used in technology, construction and renewable energy. A price spike means higher costs for everything from electric vehicles to power grids, making the US domestic industries less competitive. Plus, US manufacturers importing copper will have to bear the extra cost or pass it on to consumers — the very people Trump intends to protect.</p><p>But that’s not all. While Comex warehouse stocks have risen, LME warehouse stocks are depleting. That suggests traders are already moving metal out of London into the US to avoid future tariffs. So in the short run, Trump’s trade policy is incentivising a rush to stockpile copper before levies hit. And in the long run, this could choke off supply and create an artificial shortage, driving prices even higher.</p><p>And let’s not forget history. </p><p>Back in 2018, when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, it did a little bit to boost manufacturing jobs. For instance, tariffs on washing machines created an estimated <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-trade-war-long-term-effects-795f9226?ref=finshots.in\"><u>1,800 jobs</u></a> at firms like Samsung, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But this also came at a significant cost to the economy. These tariffs also raised costs for US businesses, disrupted supply chains, and invited retaliation from trading partners like China and the EU, which in turn raised the washing machine prices for consumers. Consumers ended up paying $1.5 billion more every year for washing machines. Or to put it another way, each new job cost the economy over $800,000 on average due to higher prices.</p><p>Copper could meet a similar fate, hurting US manufacturers more than helping them.</p><p>There are other instances in the past as well where tariffs had unintended consequences. Take the infamous Chicken Tax. </p><p>Back in the early 1960s, American poultry farmers had embraced industrial-scale production, slashing costs and therefore flooding European markets with cheap chicken. This didn’t sit well with European farmers, particularly in France and Germany, who struggled to compete. So, in a bid to protect their domestic poultry industry, they slapped hefty tariffs on American chicken imports.</p><p>Furious at what it saw as an unfair trade barrier, the US imposed a 25% tariff on light trucks, and a few other items exported by the same European nations to the US. The truck tariff, in particular, hit the EU hard, especially <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-trade-war-long-term-effects-795f9226?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Germany’s Volkswagen</u></a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/the-1960s-chicken-tax-shows-the-lasting-impact-of-tariffs-aad04b6a?ref=finshots.in\"><u>pickup trucks</u></a> were gaining popularity in the US. And just like that, a dispute over chicken escalated into what became known as the<em> Chicken War</em>.</p><p>At the time, the goal was to protect American automakers from the surge of small, fuel-efficient European vehicles. But decades later, the Chicken Tax ended up distorting the US auto market in ways no one anticipated. For one, it made foreign trucks significantly more expensive, giving domestic manufacturers like <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/the-1960s-chicken-tax-shows-the-lasting-impact-of-tariffs-aad04b6a?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Ford, General Motors and Stellantis</u></a> a near-monopoly on the segment. And while that may sound like a win for the US auto industry, it also removed competitive pressure, which could have led to better innovation and pricing.</p><p>Also, to combat tariff barriers, some foreign automakers even resorted to bizarre loopholes, like shipping their trucks as passenger vehicles and modifying them upon arrival to the US to avoid the tariff.</p><p>The end results were higher costs, inefficiencies and a market that evolved not based on consumer demand but on artificial government intervention.</p><p>So, while tariffs may seem like a powerful economic tool in the short run, history has shown that they often come with unintended costs. And as Trump looks to tighten trade restrictions while simultaneously seeking European eggs, the irony couldn’t be more obvious. Tariffs may look like a shield for domestic industries, but they could also often turn into self-inflicted wounds.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><p>Until next time…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A+story+where+we+dive+deep+into+the+side-effects+or+rather+long-term+effects+of+tariffs.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fka25yr&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fju3azb&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F5kjrda&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=A+story+where+we+dive+deep+into+the+side-effects+or+rather+long-term+effects+of+tariffs.&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\"><strong>The Story</strong></h3><p>Last week, American pharma giant Eli Lilly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-launches-weight-loss-drug-mounjaro-india-after-drug-regulator-approval-2025-03-20/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>became the first company</u></a> to launch a powerful new type of diabetes and weight-loss drug—called Tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro)—in India. This once-weekly injection belongs to a groundbreaking class of medications known as GLP-1 (and GIP) agonists, drugs that don't just control blood sugar but also help patients lose significant weight without extreme dieting.</p><p>And if things play out well, this could revolutionize the Indian healthcare market.</p><p>But before we get too ahead of ourselves, a quick biology lesson:</p><p>When you eat, your food is converted into sugar (glucose) and enters your bloodstream. Normally, your body releases insulin—a hormone that moves this sugar from your blood into your cells, where it’s used for energy. This keeps your blood sugar levels stable.</p><p>But in type 2 diabetes, either there isn’t enough insulin, or your body doesn’t respond to it properly. As a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This high blood sugar can lead to fatigue, constant hunger, and weight gain.</p><p>That’s why insulin is crucial—not just for managing blood sugar, but for preventing complications associated with diabetes.</p><p>However, here’s the thing—insulin doesn’t work alone. There’s a whole hormonal orchestra playing in the background. We won’t get into all of it here, but two key players are worth knowing: GLP-1 and GIP. Think of them as messengers. They alert your body when blood sugar rises, signal insulin to act, tell your brain when you’re full, and slow down digestion so sugar enters the bloodstream more gradually.</p><p>They do a lot of stuff in the background. </p><p>And this is exactly what the new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs is designed to mimic.</p><p>The most popular one right now is Semaglutide (promoted under brand names like <em>Ozempic</em> and <em>Wegovy</em>). It replicates the effects of GLP-1—helping the body release more insulin when needed, slowing digestion, and curbing appetite. The second, newer, better version is Tirzepatide (<em>Mounjaro</em>), the Eli Lilly drug that just launched in India. It mimics both GLP-1 and GIP. In addition to boosting insulin and reducing hunger, it also makes insulin work more efficiently—delivering even better blood sugar control.</p><p>So does this mean Indian doctors will soon start recommending Eli Lilly’s drug to every patient with Obesity and Type-2 Diabetes? </p><p>Well, the answer to that question is a tad bit complicated. According to Reuters, the injection is priced at ₹4,375 for a 5 mg vial and ₹3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial, its lowest doses. </p><p>That may not seem like a lot of first. </p><p>But patients on the drug typically see meaningful weight loss only after a few weeks—around 5 kg in 8 weeks and 10 kg in about 16 weeks, as the dose is gradually increased over time.</p><p>At the starting dose of 2.5 mg, reaching a 5 kg weight loss would require roughly 8 weekly injections, costing around ₹28,000. A 10 kg drop, usually seen over 16 weeks, would bring the total to approximately ₹56,000.</p><p>Ouch!!</p><p>But wait, that’s not all.</p><p>People often stay on these drugs for the long term, especially when they’re prescribed for type 2 diabetes management. If the goal is weight loss, doctors typically recommend using these medications continuously—even after hitting a target weight—to maintain the results.</p><p>Stopping these medications often leads to weight regain. So many patients remain on them for as long as their doctor deems necessary and they can tolerate it. </p><p>And that means over a 12 month term, you could end up spending over ₹2 lakhs on the drug alone. </p><p>That is very very expensive. </p><p>But there’s an important catch: the patents protecting these treatments won’t last forever.</p><p>For instance, Semaglutide (Ozempic) will lose its patent protection in India in 2026 and you can bet that Indian pharma companies are already preparing their own cheaper variants. Their biggest challenge right now is the nature of the treatment itself. Unlike typical medications, GLP-1–based treatments are biologics, meaning they’re large, complex proteins produced in living cells (yeast or bacteria, for example). And these proteins are so structurally intricate and unique that you can’t make an exact copy—only a very close match. </p><p>So pharma companies have to work around this problem. They have to develop \"biosimilars,\" which closely match the original drug’s safety, effectiveness, and quality, but aren't identical copies.</p><p>And not every company has the capability to produce this stuff. </p><p>The good news however is that some Indian firms have made significant progress. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02044-x?ref=finshots.in\"><u>recently launched</u></a> Lirafit, a biosimilar of another GLP-1 drug, liraglutide, priced at around ₹100 a day—about 70% cheaper than existing branded options. Meanwhile, Sun Pharmaceuticals <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-pharma-companies-develop-versions-wegovy-get-weight-loss-windfall-2024-02-22/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>is taking </u></a>a different route. Rather than replicating existing drugs, it's developing a new molecule called GL0034, designed to deliver similar or potentially better results, with a structure distinct enough to be patented on its own.</p><p>And if India’s pharmaceutical industry can crack the code, it could dramatically change access to these life-altering drugs.  India has over <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2823%2900119-5/fulltext?ref=finshots.in\"><strong><u>100 million people</u></strong></a> living with diabetes and an estimated 70 million battling obesity. Among children, the numbers are equally stark. Over 14 million children in India are estimated to be overweight or obese.  This isn’t a future problem. It’s already a national epidemic.</p><p>So yes, Eli Lilly may have taken the first step. But the real turning point will come when Indian companies bring costs down and scale access for the masses.</p><p>When will that happen?</p><p>Hopefully soon—maybe 2026.</p><p>Until then,</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+how+Eli+Lilly%E2%80%99s+new+drug+could+reshape+Indian+healthcare+and+what+might+hold+it+back.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fiywqly&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fhgvfab&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F5pbyeu&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+how+Eli+Lilly%E2%80%99s+new+drug+could+reshape+Indian+healthcare+and+what+might+hold+it+back.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

And no, it’s not a robot—it’s an open source physics engine, basically the brain behind the moves.</p><p>Let us explain…</p><p>NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang recently introduced '<a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nvidia-ai-robot-blue-stuns-124506455.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Blue</u></a>', a shiny droid with some Star Wars-style movements. But the real magic wasn’t the robot, it was Newton. This simulation tool helps robots understand the real world—not just by seeing it, but by feeling it. Think of it as giving robots a sense of touch and balance. So whether it’s holding a sandwich or assembling a chair, Newton<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-and-google-deepmind-will-help-power-disneys-cute-robots/?ref=finshots.in\"> <u>teaches robots</u></a> how squishy, hard, slippery, or crumbly stuff actually behaves.</p><p>It even teaches them how to move like us through different types of motion. Perpetual ones like walking (movements that keep going without stopping). Periodic ones like waving (repeating actions in rhythm). And episodic ones like picking something up and putting it back down (actions with clear start and end).</p><p>And the best part is all this learning happens in simulation before the robot steps in the real world. </p><p>So all that means smarter robots, quicker learning, and way less trial-and-error in real life. And this is huge because until now, robots were awkward learners. But Newton gives them a virtual playground to fail, learn, and improve. Just like humans do.</p><p>And if robots can now learn to move like us… who knows, maybe one day they’ll learn to dance like us too? 😄</p><p><strong>Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVtKEX90SZ0&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Maand</u></a> by Bayaan</p><p>Thanks for the lyrical recommendation, Sanjay Jacob!</p><p><strong>What caught our eye this week 👀</strong></p><p><em>Would you like banking on time?</em></p><p>Imagine a place where every time you help an elderly person with their groceries, walk them to a doctor’s appointment, or simply spend an hour keeping them company, you're not just doing a good deed but also earning hours for your own future. Hours you can cash in when you’re old and need help.</p><p>Well, there actually is a place that’s seeing this happen and it’s none other than Switzerland.</p><p>The Swiss government has introduced something called a “<a href=\"https://www.pulse.com.gh/articles/lifestyle/switzerlands-time-bank-lets-citizens-save-time-for-future-care-heres-how-2025031911073407163?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Time Bank</u></a>.” The idea? It’s beautifully simple: Young people volunteer their time to support senior citizens today and in return, they earn \"time credits\" that can be redeemed when they require assistance themselves.</p><p>And the initiative has gained traction. In St. Gallen, over 50,000 hours have already been volunteered to support elderly and many countries including Japan, Spain, New Zealand are welcoming such initiatives.</p><p>Wow. It’s not money, it’s time. A kind of social currency that works on empathy and reciprocity.</p><p>And the idea is a timely one. You see, globally, we’re aging faster than we can prepare for. By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over, and by 2050,<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"> <u>over 2 billion</u></a> people will be aged 60 or older.

And with families becoming smaller, nuclear, and more scattered we can see why the traditional joint family support system isn’t as robust as it used to be.</p><p>Now, India does have a strong culture of caregiving and respect for elders—but that doesn’t always translate into available help. Especially in urban areas where time is scarce and<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/health/story/unmasking-loneliness-the-silent-epidemic-sweeping-india-and-the-world-2494802-2024-01-29?ref=finshots.in\"> <u>loneliness</u></a> is rising. So, could a \"Time Bank\" work in India?</p><p>Well, we do have a few building blocks. India already runs the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and we also have NGOs and state-led schemes offering home-based elder care. But most of it is reactive, not preventive or future-facing. And a system where you earn future care through today’s service could nudge young Indians to engage more consciously with aging.</p><p>It can reduce the burden on healthcare and elderly homes, it can build stronger intergenerational bonds, and it could shift care from being a charity to a system of mutual respect and investment. And if implemented well, it could even be integrated with existing systems where time credits can be stored securely and accessed nationwide. Or what if students earned community credits for college by helping senior citizens? What if companies gave paid time off to employees who volunteered in elderly care?</p><p>The options are many and perhaps, like the Swiss, we could start banking some time too.</p><p><strong>Infographic 📊</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4iYZCt4624E0lLkisbirCPrq2eXK4O6-lMx4JMOTkFSLCKyKS1obFeZ-zcjONSOMg_AXVOs6Oa75ORmMogEsL6KtjeaDL8ym_TnZ0E8eDT26A9LyE2CJhV7_v-Cw3T6NqydG4?key=oBKbg1yWPf3pomA-vmEbhIL6\" width=\"512\"/></figure><p><strong>This Day in Financial History 📜</strong></p><p><em>March 22, 1993: Intel announces the Pentium processor</em></p><p>On this day, Intel introduced the world to its <a href=\"https://timeline.intel.com/1993/the-birth-of-pentium?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Pentium processor</u></a>, a chip that gave personal computers a much-needed speed boost. </p><p>But before we move further ahead, would you mind checking what processor is running your laptop right now?</p><p>Moving on, for the uninitiated, the Pentium was essentially a microprocessor or, in simple words, the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/glossary/what-is-cpu/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>brain of a computer</u></a>. Also known as CPUs (central processing units), these microprocessors are responsible for executing all the instructions—whether it’s opening an app, loading a webpage, or running a game, it controls the flow of data and instructions to carry out a range of tasks.</p><p>Before the Pentium came along, <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Pentium?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Intel’s 486 processor</u></a> was running the show. But the Pentium took things to a whole new level.</p><p>For starters, it was way faster. Unlike the 486, which processed one instruction at a time, the Pentium could juggle multiple instructions simultaneously. Add to that an improved floating-point unit (FPU), and suddenly, complex mathematical calculations, crucial for gaming and graphics, became a breeze.</p><p>But the Pentium wasn’t just famous for its innovations. It also made headlines for one of the biggest tech blunders. While it was marketed as having faster floating-point calculations, a year after its launch, a math professor, Thomas Nicely, conducting research on prime numbers, discovered that the Pentium occasionally got division calculations wrong. When he ran the same calculation on older computers (not using the Pentium processor), the results were accurate. This confirmed that the issue was specific to the Pentium-run computers.</p><p>Public disappointment forced Intel to recall and replace the faulty chips, costing Intel a jaw-dropping <a href=\"https://techovedas.com/475-million-fdiv-bug-how-intels-pentium-processor-costly-flaw-shook-the-tech-world/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>$475 million</u></a> (over a billion dollars today!). </p><p>But despite the hiccup, the Pentium brand lived on, evolving over multiple generations and playing a key role in shaping modern computing. Then came the 1990s dot-com boom that led to an explosion in PC and server demand, driven by the internet revolution. Intel’s Pentium chips were at the heart of most personal computers.</p><p>And the rest is history. We say this because if you had checked your processor by now, chances are it is from Intel!</p><p><strong>Readers Recommend 🗒️</strong></p><p>This week, our reader Santhoshi Andalam recommends reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123136728-orbital?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Orbital by Samantha Harvey</u></a>. </p><p>Santhoshi tells us this book is about 6 astronauts orbiting the Earth – 16 times every 24 hours for 9 months – collecting data, observing the atmosphere and doing all the astronaut things.

And recently IndusInd Bank reminded everyone why that story still matters.</p><p>The bank disclosed a gap in how it accounted for forex derivative losses — ignoring mark-to-market rules and failing to hedge its exposure. Instead of showing losses, it booked them as receivables. The result? ₹19,000 crores in market value wiped out and the RBI now investigating if other banks might be doing something similar.</p><p>Now, IndusInd isn’t accused of fraud like Barings Bank was. But the lapse is worrying. Because when banks mismanage derivatives (powerful but risky financial tools) it doesn’t just hurt profits. It chips away at public trust - and you can know why this is crucial in our <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/when-derivatives-go-wrong-indusind-bank-barings/\"><u>Monday’s newsletter</u></a>. </p><h3 id=\"pakistan%E2%80%99s-investment-woes\">Pakistan’s investment woes</h3><p>Pakistan’s inflation is finally under control. The stock market looks good. And short-term foreign investors are back. So, all’s good, right? Well… not quite.</p><p>The country’s investment-to-GDP ratio has hit a 64-year low of just 13%. Its wealthy elites are still pouring money into luxury real estate and flashy cars, not long-term industry or infrastructure. Why? Because decades of debt dependence, broken tax systems, and weak industry have made real investment risky and unattractive.</p><p>Pakistan now needs $146 billion over the next 5 years just to service its debt. And without productive investments, it’s trapped in a borrow-pay-repeat cycle. </p><p>So in our <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/pakistans-investment-woes/\"><u>Tuesday story</u></a>, we tell you what’s keeping investments away from Pakistan and if there’s a way out.</p><h3 id=\"who-watches-the-watchdog\">Who watches the watchdog?</h3><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is India’s official public finance watchdog. It’s caught scams like 2G and Coalgate, exposed state-level fund misuse, and held governments to account.</p><p>But now, the Supreme Court has admitted a plea questioning how the CAG is appointed. The PIL says the CAG shouldn’t be handpicked by the ruling party — it should be chosen by an independent panel.</p><p>Why? Because recent audits show a worrying trend: some being stalled, others triggering political storms, and some turning into federal face-offs.</p><p>So if the auditor isn’t truly independent, who’s keeping the government in check? That’s the question at the heart of this petition and we break it down in our <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/who-watches-the-watchdog-cag/\"><u>Wednesday newsletter</u></a>. </p><h3 id=\"what-keeps-coke-out-and-pepsi-deep-in-the-snacking-market\">What keeps Coke out and Pepsi deep in the snacking market?</h3><p>PepsiCo sells both drinks and snacks. Coca-Cola? Just drinks. That’s a bit odd, considering snacks make up 80% of Pepsi’s revenue in India and the country’s snack market is booming.</p><p>So why hasn’t Coca-Cola joined the munch fest, you ask? Because it’s still focused on dominating beverages — especially in rural India, where household penetration is still low. Jumping into snacks would mean splitting resources, building new supply chains, and possibly diluting its brand. Plus, raw materials like potatoes and corn are more volatile than bottling syrup.</p><p>And we take a closer look at both these companies in our <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/what-keeps-coke-out-and-pepsi-deep-in-the-snacking-market/\"><u>Thursday newsletter</u></a>.</p><h3 id=\"will-lic-change-the-health-insurance-market-in-india\">Will LIC change the health insurance market in India?</h3><p>India’s insurance giant LIC is reportedly eyeing a significant stake in an existing health insurance company. And if it enters the health insurance space, that could change the game.</p><p>With a massive agent and partner network, LIC could bring health insurance to every corner of India. Think life + health insurance combos, bundled products, and possibly cheaper premiums (thanks to cross-subsidizing from its life insurance profits).</p><p>But not everyone’s thrilled. Health insurers worry LIC might undercut them, spark a price war, and hurt margins. Plus, if life insurers are allowed back into full-fledged health insurance, it could shake up the market’s regulatory stability.</p><p>So is there a silver lining to this?

They’re planning to buy a significant stake in an existing health insurance company (likely ManipalCigna), which looks like preparation for a full-fledged entry into health insurance. Plus, there's buzz around a possible \"composite license\" that might let life insurers directly sell health policies too (though initial talks suggest it might be limited to private-sector insurers).</p><p>But irrespective of how things unfold, let's imagine LIC fully enters health insurance. What's likely to happen first?</p><p>Well, for starters LIC will probably spend a significant amount of time just understanding and setting up the business. Health insurance isn't as straightforward as life insurance—it needs specialized skills and infrastructure. For example, LIC will have to invest in experts who can design health-specific products, understand actuarial calculations around illnesses and build the capability to manage complex relationships with healthcare providers—like hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic labs.</p><p>Health insurance also has a much higher volume of claims compared to life insurance. That means LIC would need systems to handle a continuous stream of claims efficiently. Once they learn the ropes, then you can start thinking about the impact. </p><p>One of the biggest positives of LIC entering the health insurance market would be significantly better penetration—essentially, more people getting insured.</p><p>LIC has one of the strongest distribution networks in India. Imagine this <a href=\"https://licindia.in/documents/20121/1125636/Corporate+Presentation+-+12.02.2025.pdf/1cbd1752-6726-77f8-8800-73d5c7362236?t=1739357313352&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>massive network</u></a>—14 lakh individual agents, 85 banks, 85 corporate agents, 309 brokers, and 154 insurance marketing firms (IMFs), along with thousands of common service centers. Right now, they're all selling LIC's life insurance products. But if LIC starts offering regular health insurance too, this entire network instantly becomes a powerful channel for selling health insurance policies as well.</p><p>Think about it – If you're already buying life insurance from an LIC agent, wouldn't it be convenient to buy your health insurance from the same person? Most customers don't really differentiate between life or non-life insurance—what they truly want is simple protection against medical expenses. And the demand for indemnity-based health policies (the type that directly covers hospital expenses) is huge.</p><p>And LIC could also innovate a bit here. Consider \"Combi products\"—policies that combine life insurance and health insurance into one simple package. A single policy might offer ₹50 lakh life cover along with ₹5 lakh hospitalization cover. If LIC could offer them at competitive prices due to their massive scale, we could see a sea change in the industry. </p><p>But not everyone is happy about these developments. General insurance companies and standalone health insurers have expressed concerns about allowing life insurance companies to sell health policies.</p><p>One of their biggest concerns is cross-subsidization.</p><p>Think about it this way: because LIC runs a highly profitable life insurance business, it could potentially offer health insurance products at lower premiums by funneling profits from life insurance into health insurance.</p><p>For instance, imagine LIC earns ₹100 crore in profit annually from its life insurance segment. It could afford to use part of this profit—say, ₹20 crore—to subsidize health insurance premiums. So, if other standalone health insurance companies are charging ₹10,000 annually for a similar policy, LIC might offer it at just ₹8,000.</p><p>While consumers would love this cheaper pricing, it might trigger a price war. Competitors, forced to match LIC's low premiums, would see their margins shrink drastically. This could destabilize the industry and negatively affect profitability across standalone and general insurance companies.</p><p>But here's the thing—general insurance companies in India already sell different kinds of policies like health, motor, and travel insurance together. They're already cross-subsidizing these policies to offer attractive prices. And yet, this hasn't caused any real problems or major disruptions. If anything, customers have gotten better deals and more affordable policies.</p><p>So, it’s hard to argue that cross-subsidization is a net-negative. If anything, it could actually be good news—leading to lower prices and healthier competition overall. </p><p>But there’s another argument against allowing LIC or other life insurers from selling indemnity-based health insurance and it relates to regulatory stability and investor confidence.</p><p>Here's some context: <a href=\"https://irdai.gov.in/documents/37343/366723/Report+on+the+Feasibility+of+allowing+Life+Insurers+to+offer+Indemnity+base.pdf/d19f2513-9e22-f681-7462-2a5ab7ed1044?version=1.1&amp;t=1665242038288&amp;download=true&amp;ref=finshots.in#:~:text=Life%20insurers%20in%20India%20had,issue%20indemnity%20based%20health%20policies.\"><u>Until 2016</u></a>, life insurers in India sold indemnity-based health policies—these are the kind that directly cover hospital bills or medical costs through reimbursement or cashless facilities. But in 2016, regulations changed. Life insurers were restricted to selling only fixed-benefit policies (like critical illness). </p><p>For example, instead of paying the actual medical bills, these policies pay a pre-decided amount when a specific event happens. For example, if you have a critical illness policy and you're diagnosed with cancer, the insurer might pay you a lump sum of ₹10 lakh, regardless of what your actual medical expenses are. </p><p>This is very different from indemnity-based health insurance, where your insurance covers the actual expenses—whether that’s ₹50,000 for a minor surgery or ₹5 lakh for a major procedure. And that’s why the 2016 rule change was significant: it forced life insurers out of the full-fledged health insurance space, leaving that business exclusively to general and specialized health insurers.</p><p>Now, reversing this policy after just a few years might seem unfair to investors. </p><p>The only silver lining for existing insurers is that the composite license may not be granted to LIC. If that happens, LIC would have to operate like any other health or general insurance company. While they’d still have the advantage of their massive distribution network, the other benefits we discussed—like bundling health and life insurance or leveraging cross-subsidization—might not materialize.</p><p>So yeah, we will just have to wait and see how LIC decides to tap into the health insurance market. </p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+about+the+good+and+the+bad+of+LIC+entering+the+health+insurance+market.++https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fhp7z1x&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fcvwvse&amp;ref=finshots.in\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fz6v8w5&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+about+the+good+and+the+bad+of+LIC+entering+the+health+insurance+market.+&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story.</p><hr/><h3 id=\"the-story\">The Story</h3><p>Over the last decade, India has been rushing to add a lot of solar and wind power to its <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/summer-power-cut-why-indias-grid-managers-concerned-9894350/?ref=finshots.in\"><u>electricity system</u></a>. In theory, that sounds great. Clean, renewable energy is good for the planet.</p><p>But here’s the problem. Most of these renewables don’t have proper storage systems like big batteries to save the extra energy generated during the day for use later. So, when the sun sets in the evening, especially during those hot summer months of May and June when people still need fans, ACs and lights, there’s a power shortage. Solar panels stop working, but the demand stays high.</p><p>To make things worse (but better for the climate of course), India also slowed down building new thermal power plants — the coal plants that act as reliable, always-on sources to keep the grid stable when renewable supply drops.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/04/Electricity-graph-1.jpg\" width=\"525\"/><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy_Statistics_2025/Energy%20Statistics%20India%202025_27032025.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u><span class=\"underline\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>This means that without enough of these steady sources, the electricity grid becomes unstable, and power outages start becoming more frequent. For context, as of March 2024, India had an estimated total electricity generation capacity of about <a href=\"https://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy_Statistics_2025/Energy%20Statistics%20India%202025_27032025.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>520 GW</u></a> — around 280 GW from coal or thermal energy, 198 GW from renewables and the rest from gas and nuclear. But in May 2024, India’s peak power demand hit <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/power-cuts-in-india-to-rise-by-2027-report/article68467851.ece?ref=finshots.in\"><u>250 GW</u></a>. That left very little breathing room or spare capacity for thermal plants to increase their plant load factor (PLF). That’s basically, how much of their maximum capacity is actually being used. These plants are already working hard, and there isn’t much extra capacity left to ramp up further when demand spikes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1149\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2025/04/graph--5-.png\" width=\"1946\"/></figure><p>And this problem isn’t going away. India’s power consumption grew by 7% in 2023, compared to the global average of just 2%.</p><p>So yeah, while the country plans to increase renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, if demand and supply don’t grow at the same pace, power cuts could become a regular thing. At least that’s what a research report from the India Energy and Climate Centre, University of California, says.</p><p>But it seems as though India’s electricity authorities want to prove this theory wrong. Just a few days ago, the <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2121429&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>Central Electricity Authority</u></a> (CEA) launched a new indigenously built software tool called STELLAR. It’s basically a smart simulator for India’s electricity grid or a master planner for electricity generation, transmission, storage and demand management. It helps discoms (power distribution companies) figure out how much power they’ll need in the future, where it should come from, where to store it, and how to balance supply and demand without wasting money or causing blackouts.</p><p>The best part? It’s being shared free of cost with all states and discoms, so everyone works off the same standard tool, improving planning and cutting unnecessary costs.</p><p>Also, it ensures that discoms have sufficient power supply to meet demand without overcapacity, which the <a href=\"https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2023/jun/doc2023628218801.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>Ministry of Power’s guidelines</u></a> from June 2023, warned against. Because when states overestimate their needs, it leads to idle capacity, unnecessary capital expenses and higher operational costs for discoms. Sure, this extra cost can be passed on to consumers through higher tariffs. But then, that’s not really something consumers will like, nor is it good for a state’s political environment, since power pricing in India is primarily regulated by the state.</p><p>The smarter way is to find a balance. And that’s what STELLAR aims to do. It improves pricing efficiency by using real time data and forecasting, allowing for more accurate, cost reflective tariffs. Plus, by supporting dynamic pricing models like <a href=\"https://finshots.in/archive/an-explainer-on-time-of-day-electricity-tariff/#:~:text=This%20split%20will%20probably%20vary,what%20TOD%20is%20all%20about.\"><u>Time of Day (TOD) tariffs</u></a>, it encourages people to shift their power use to cheaper, off-peak hours. If you’re new to TOD, here’s how it works. The day is divided into three parts — solar hours, peak hours and normal hours. Use more power during solar hours, pay less. Use it when demand spikes after sunset, pay more. That’s the idea.</p><p>This can reduce pressure on the grid, lower system costs and cut down on the need for expensive backup options like diesel generators. And hopefully, prevent massive blackouts like the one in July 2012, when <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/powering-ahead-how-india-made-big-electricity-blackouts-a-thing-of-the-past/articleshow/110654743.cms?from=mdr&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><u>620 million people</u></a> or 9% of the world’s population at the time, were left in the dark.</p><p>But does that mean that STELLAR can just magically fix India’s power supply problems?</p><p>Well, maybe not. Because here’s the thing. While the tool itself is free for discoms, its benefits might still be limited. And that’s mainly due to the fact that Indian discoms aren’t exactly in the best of health.</p><p>To put things into perspective, according to rating agency <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/discoms-face-financial-constraints-due-to-payment-delays-from-govt-icra-124081301448_1.html?ref=finshots.in\"><u>ICRA</u></a>, the all India aggregate technical and commercial (AT&amp;C) losses, which basically means losses that happen due to inefficient transmission, distribution issues, theft or unpaid bills, dropped from 23% in FY21 to 16% in FY23, thanks to infrastructure upgrades and subsidies from state governments. These subsidies help discoms keep electricity affordable for certain consumers.</p><p>Sounds like progress, right? But here’s the issue. Discoms in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh are still struggling, sitting on losses, some even above 20%.</p><p>And when discoms are already struggling financially, they might not be in a position to implement necessary changes or invest in complementary infrastructure to truly benefit from a tool like STELLAR even if it’s being handed to them for free. And if state governments delay those subsidies we mentioned earlier, discoms face cash flow problems, making matters worse. They might barely be able to cover operational expenses, let alone spend on optimising their systems with new tools.</p><p>Increasing tariffs to recover costs isn’t easy either. In India, electricity prices <a href=\"https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Getting-India-Electricity-Prices-Right_UPDATED_1-2.pdf?ref=finshots.in\"><u>aren’t entirely market driven</u></a>. State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) set these tariffs, trying to strike a tricky balance, keeping discoms financially alive while ensuring people don’t burn holes in their pockets over power bills. To do this, they rely on cross subsidies. That means industries pay more so that the agricultural sector and households can pay less.</p><p>Now, the National Tariff Policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, says that these subsidies can’t stretch beyond ±20% of the average cost of supply (ACoS). But here’s the catch. According to a paper by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, more than half the power sold in India breaks this rule. The biggest underpayers being domestic and agricultural consumers, who end up paying much less than they ideally should.</p><p>And here’s why fixing this is so difficult. A quote from the paper explains it well:</p><blockquote><em>The general principle of raising tariffs quickly becomes political, more so if this is done disproportionately for one consumer group. Unfortunately, the lowest-priced segments are the ones with the greatest political clout—Residential and Agricultural.<br/><br/>How much tariff rise is too much? Much more than inflation is likely to be considered burdensome, but legacy issues including cost structure and demographic differences are also factors in tariff rises. A DisCom with limited (or even nil) tariff hikes in recent years, for whatever reason, needs a large jump.<br/><br/>Any substantial rise needs to be spread out over several years.</em></blockquote><p>So yeah, that might derail India’s plan for a rightly priced, balanced electricity supply with zero power cuts. And until we fix that, STELLAR might not be such a stellar idea after all.</p><p><em>Don’t forget to share this story on </em><a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An+explainer+on+STELLAR%2C+the+Central+Electricity+Authority%27s+new+tool+that+might+just+put+an+end+to+load+shedding.+https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2F3uezfv&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>WhatsApp</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fpikunh&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fditto.sh%2Fj2y14n&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An+explainer+on+STELLAR%2C+the+Central+Electricity+Authority%27s+new+tool+that+might+just+put+an+end+to+load+shedding.&amp;ref=finshots.in\"><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</section>"
